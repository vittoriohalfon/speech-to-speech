Opinion of the Court.
as one consolidated and powerful association for the purpose
of stifling competition among themselves, and of thus keeping
their rates and charges higher than they might otherwise be
under the laws of competition. And this is so, even though
the rates provided for in the agreement may for the time be
not more than are reasonable. They may easily and at any
time be increased. It is the combination of these large and
powerful corporations, covering vast sections of territory
and influencing trade throughout the whole extent thereof,
and acting as one bbdy in all the matters over which the
combinatfon extends, that constitutes the alleged evil, and in
regard to which, so far as the combination operates upon and
restrains interstate commerce, Congress has power to legislate
and to prohibit.
The prohibition of such contracts may in the judgment of
Congress be one of the reasonable necessities for the proper
regulation of commerce, and Congress is the judge of such
necessity and propriety, unless, in case of a possible gross per-
version of the principle, the courts might be applied to for
relief.
The cases cited by the respondents' counsel in regard to the
general constitutional right of the citizen to make contracts
relating to his lawful business are not inconsistent with the
existence of the power of Congress to prohibit contracts of
the nature involved in this case. The power to regulate com-
merce has no limitation other than those prescribed in the
Constitution. The power, however, does not carry with it the
right to destroy or impair those limitations and guarantees
which are also placed in. the Constitution or in any of the
-amendments to that instrument. Monongahela Navigation
Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312-336; interstate Com-
merce Commission v. Brim8on, 154 U. S. 447-4*79.
Among these limitations and guarantees counsel refer to
those which provide that no person shall be deprived of life,
liberty or property without due process of law, and that pri-
vate property shall not be taken for public use'without just
compensation. The latter limitation is, we think, plainly
irrelevant.

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.
As to the former, it is claimed that the citizen is deprived
-of his liberty without due process of law when, by a general
-statute, he is arbitrarily deprived of the right to make a con-
tract of the nature herein involved.
-The case of Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578, is cited
as authority for the statement concerfiing the right to con-
.tract. In speaking of the meaning of the word "liberty," as
used in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, it
was said in that case to include, among other things, the lib-
erty of the citizen to pursue any' livelihood or vocation, and
for that purpose to enter into all contracts which might be
proper, necessary and essential to his carrying out those ob-
jects to a successful conclusion.
We do not impugn the correctness of that statement. The
citizen may have the right to make a proper (that is, a lawful)
-contract, one which is also essential and necessary for carrying
-out his lawful purposes. The question which arises here is,
whether the contract is a proper or lavful one, and we have
not advanced a step towards its solution by-saying that.the
.citizen is protected by the Fifth, or any other amendment, in
his right to make proper contracts to enable him to carry out
his. lawful purposes. We presume it will not be contended
that the court meant, in stating the right of the citizen "to
pursue any livelihood or vocation," to include every means of
-obtaining a livelihood, 'whether it was lawful or otherwise.
Precisely how far a legislature can go in declaring'a certain
means of obtaining a livelihood unlawful, it is unnecessary
here to speak of. It will be conceded it has power to make
some kinds of vocations and some methods of obtaining a
livelihood unlawful, and in regard to those the citizen would
have no right to contract to carry them on.
Congress may restrain individuals from making contracts
under certain circumstances and upon certain subjects. Frilsie
v. United States, 151 U. S. 160.
Notwithstanding the general liberty of contract which is
possessed by the citizen under the Constitution, we find that
there are many kinds of contracts which, while not in them-
selves immoral or mala in se, may yet be prohibited by the

legislation of the States or, in certain cases, by Congress.
The question comes back whether the statute under review is
a legitimate exercise of the power of Congress over interstate
commerce and a valid regulation thereof. The question is, for
us, one of power only, and not of policy. We think the power
exists in Congress, and that the statute is therefore valid.
Finally, we are asked to reconsider the question decided in
the Trans8-Jisouric ase, and to retrace the steps taken therein,
because of the plain error contained in that decision and the.
widespread alarm with which it was received and the serious.
consequences which have resulted, or may soon result, from
the law as interpreted in that case.
It is proper to remark that an application for a reconsidera-
tion of a question but lately decided by this court is usually
based upon a statement that some of the arguments employed
on the original hearing of the question have been overlooked
or misunderstood, or that some controlling authority has been
either misapplied by the court or passed over without discus-
sion or notice. While this is not strictly an application for a
rehearing in the same case, yet in substance it is the same.
thing. The court is asked to reconsider a question but just
decided after a careful investigation of the matter involved.
There have heretofore been in effect two arguments of pre-
cisely the same questions now before the court, and the same
arguments were addressed to us on both those occasions. The.
report of the Tas-Aissouri case shows a dissenting opinion
delivered in that case, and that the opinion was concurred in
by three other members of the court.
That opinion, it will "be seen, gives with great force and-
ability the arguments against the decision which was finally
arrived at by the court. It was after.a full discussion of the
questions involved and with the knowledge of the views enter-
tained by the minority as expressed in the dissenting opinion
that the majority of the court came to the conclusion it did.
Soon after the decision a petition for a rehearing of the case
was made, supported by a printed argument in its favor, and
pressed with an earnestness and vigor and at a length .which
were certainly commensurate with the importance of the case.
