ing any one of them to undue or unreasonable prejudice or
disadvantage, is declared to be unlawful.
"Reasonable, proper and equal facilities for the interchange
of traffic between lines, and for the receiving, forwarding and
delivering of passengers and property between connecting
lines is required, and discrimination in rates and charges as
between connecting lines is forbidden.
"It is made unlawful to charge or receive any greater com-
pensation in the aggregate for the transportation of passen-
gers or the like kind of property under substantially similar
circumstances and conditions for a shorter than for a longer
distance over the same line in the same direction, the shorter
being included within the longer distance.
"Contracts, agreements or combinations for the pooling of
freights of different and competing railroads, or for dividing
between them the aggregate or net earnings of such railroads
or any portion thereof, are declared to be unlawful.
"All carriers subject to the law are required to print their
tariffs for the transportation of persons and property, and to
keep them for public inspection at every depot or station on
their roads. An advance in rates is not to be made until
after ten days' public notice, but a reduction in rates may be
made to take effect at once, the notice of the same being im-
mediately and publicly given. The rates publicly notified
are to be the maximum as well as the minimum charges which
can be collected or received for the services respectively for
which they purport to be established.
" Copies of all tariffs are required to be filed with this com-
mission, which is also to be promptly notified of all changes
that shall be made in the same. The joint tariffs of connect-
ing roads are also required to be filed, and also copies of all
contracts, agreements or arrangements between carriers in
relation to traffic affected by the act.
"It is made unlawful for any carrier to enter into any combi-
nation, contract or agreement, expressed or implied, to prevent,
by change of time schedules, carriage in different cars, or by
other means or devices, the carriage of freights from being con-
tinuous from the place of shipment to the place of destination."

These provisions substantially exist in the act. as now in
force, except that by an amendment made March 2, 1889, it
was provided that rates should not be reduced by carriers
except upon three days' public notice of an intention so to do.
This summary of the act, which omits reference to a num-
ber of its provisions relating to the power of the commission
and the mode in which these powers are to be exercised, will
suffice for an examination of the matter in hand.
Now, a consideration of the terms of the statute, I submit,
makes it clear that the contract here sought to be avoided
as illegal is either directly sanctioned or impliedly authorized
thereby. That the act did not contemplate that the relations
of the carrier should be confined to his own line and to business
going over such line alone, is conclusively shown by the fact
that the act specifically provides for joint and continuous lines;
in other words, for agreements between several roads to compose
a joint line. That these agreements are to arise from contract
is also shown by the fact that the law provides for the filing
of such contracts with the commission. And it was also con-
templated that the agreements should cover joint rates, since
it provides for the making of such joint tariffs and for their
publication and filing with the commission. The making of a
tariff of this character includes necessarily agreements for the
classification of freight, as the freight classification is the essen-
tial element in the making up of a rate. That the interstate
commerce rates, all of which are controlled by the provisions
as to reasonableness, were not intended to fluctuate hourly and
daily as competition might ebb and flow, results from the fact
that the published rates could not either be increased or
reduced, except after a specified time. It follows, then, that
agreements as to reasonable rates and against their secret reduc-
tion conform exactly to the terms of the act. Indeed, the
authority to make agreements on this subject not only results
from the terms of the act just referred to, but from its
mandatory provisions forbidding discrimination against or
preference to persons and places. The argument that these
provisions referred to joint lines alone and not to competitive
lines is without force; since joint rates necessarily relate to and

are influenced by the rates on competitive lines. To illustrate,
suppose three joint lines of railroads between Chicago and
New York, each made up of many roads. How could a joint
rate be agreed on by the roads composing one of these con-
tinuous lines, without an ascertainment of the rate existing
on the other continuous line? What contract could be made
with safety for transportation over one of the lines without
taking into account the rate of all the others? There cer-
tainly could be no prevention of unjust discrimination as to
the persons and places within a given territory, unless the
rates of all competing lines within the territory be considered
and the sudden change of the published rates of all such lines
be guarded against.
I do not further elaborate the reasons demonstrating that
classification is essential to 'rate making, and that a joint rate
to be feasible must consider the competitive rates in the same
territory, since these propositions are to me self-evident, and
their correctness is substantiated by statements found in the
reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission to Congress,
of which reports judicial notice may be taken. Heath v.
Wallace, 138 U. S. 573, 584.
I excerpt from some of these reports of the commission to
Congress statements bearing on these subjects,, as well as
other statements indicating that agreements among carriers,
competitive as well as connecting, for the purpose of securing
a uniform classification and preventing of undercutting of
rates, underbilling, etc., existed prior to the Interstate Com-
merce Act, were continued thereafter, and were deemed not to
be forbidden by law, but, on the contrary, were considered as
instruments tending to secure its successful evolution. Whilst
it is doubtless true that in a recent report the commission, as
now constituted, has said that agreements between competi-
tors to prevent the undercutting of rates may operate to cause
carriers to disregard the lawful orders of the commission,
this fact does not change the legal inference to be deduced
from the construction placed upon the law by those charged
with its administration in the period immediately following
its adoption and which was then reported to Congress.
