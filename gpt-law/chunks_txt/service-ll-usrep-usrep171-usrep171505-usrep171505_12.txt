operate with the Interstate Commerce Commission to secure
stability and uniformity in the rates, fares, charges and rules
established hereunder."
Here is, in words as clear and specific as the English lan-
guage is capable of, a distinct jurisdictional limitation upon
the powers of the managers, as described in the preceding sec-
tion, and in terms the clause provides that the powers conferred
upon the managers shall be so construed and exercised as not
to permit the violation of the Interstate Commerce act, or any
other law, and so forth; and it commands the -managers to
co6perate to these ends with the Interstate Commerce Com-
mission.
When the managers come to act, then, under these powers,
how do they start? They start with a system of rates estab-
lished, not by the agreement, but before it was made, and con-
firmed by the agreement, which were confessedly in: conformity
with and in promotion of the Commerce act, and which were
absolutely just and reasonable. The managers are to have
authority to recommend such changes in those rates and fares
as, by the very words of the second section, may be reasonable
and just and necessary for governing the traffic and protecting
the interests of the jarties. Reasonableness and justice is the
first and fundamental condition of their starting to act at all,
and it is declared that they shall not act otherwise than in con-
formity with the requirements I have already mentioned con-
tained in the Commerce act. Can this be an authority to
restrain trade under any definition of the word "restraint" ?
The only restraint is a restraint against a violation of law by
the managers in agreeing upon unreasonable and unjust rates
against the requirements of the Commerce act. 'If we assume
that the restraint of trade mentioned in the Trust act may be
a restraint of innocent and just proceeding, can any one main-
tain that it makes- illegal an agreement not to violate law,, but
to obey it?
It was obvious when this agreement was made that rates
then existing and being in all particulars reasonable and equal,
might, in the course of changes in production, trade, and under
other conditions over which the railways could have no control,

become unjust, unreasonable and inapplicable to the new con-
ditions, and that in such case. both public and private interests
would require that readjustments should be made in order to
bring the rates into conformity with what reason, justice and
law should require under such conditions. It was to provide
for this that sections 2 and 3 of the seventh article were
inserted. As I have said, they were inserted in such clear
language that it would be impossible for the- managers to
agree upon any rates in lieu of the just one then existing, that
were not, in the same sense and to the same extent, just, rea-
sonable and for the public interest, as those then existing.
The managers must act in that way and to that end, or else
they were forbidden by the very terms of the agreement to
act at all.
If the managers, contrary to their authority, should have
agreed upon a new rate which any one of the independent
roads thought to be wrong in itself as being unreasonable bnd
not in conformity with the requirements of the article and of
law, that company, or any number of companies affected,
could lawfully and justly (as would be its bounden duty) refuse
to conform to the rate of the managers. But it is asked,
would not the road thus refusing be subjected to the fines and
forfeitures provided in another part of the agreement, and
would not it be turned out of the asso-ciation ? I answer em-
phatically, no. If any such thing were attempted under the
circumstances named, the company could defend itself in a
court of justice against any such Wrongful exaction, and could
compel the managers and its associate roads to obey the con-
tract, and to give it its just equality of treatment that it was
before entitled to. The Commerce act itself in terms requires
the same reasonable and just conduct by railways towards each
other as it does in their treatment of their customers and the
public. I most earnestly maintain, therefore, that the whole
and every part of Article VII is perfectly valid under any
possible construction of the language of the Trust act, as well
as in perfect conformity with and in aid of the Commerce act.
I may as well here compare the provisions of Article VII,
which contains the great leading feature of the whole agree-

ment, with the agreement in the Trans-Alissouri case. The
difference is broad and fundamental. In this case, as I have
shown, the rates agreed to be adhered to in the first section
of Article VII had already been independently established,
were, in fact, reasonable and just, were on file and inferentially
approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and they
had been assailed by nobody, and the whole trade of the
country affected was proceeding under them with. advantage
to the shippers, to the people along the lines of the roads, to
the railways themselves, and to the general interests of the
country. It- was an engagement to stand by that state of
things and for the express purpose of continuing that happy
state of things - exactly those that the law requires - that
this engagement was made. Turn now to the Trans-Missouri
agreement on the same part of the subject. That agreement
did not propose or profess to stand by any then existing rates,
it did not indicate that the rates then existing were just or
reasonable, but it proposed to put into the hands of its mana-
gers the power to establish de novo reasonable rates, etc.; and,
in-the very words of the agreement, for the purpose of mutual
protection, and for nothing else. I
The Trans-Missouri agreement imposed no restriction upon
the discretion of its rate-making board; it did not impose and
,did not, evidently, intend to impose the distinct barriers of the
law between the powers of its rate board and the people and
any one of the roads concerned. It did not profess to look to
any other interest than the exclusive interest of the parties
themselves; and it will be seen, on a careful study of it, that
it was construed and constructed for the sole purpose of keep-
ing up and increasing rates, instead of for the purpose (as in
the Joint Traffic agreement) of keeping them just and in con-
formity with law, whether by reduction, increase or other re-
adjustment.
Other essential differences are stated in my brief which I
need not take the time of the court to enlarge upon.
These differences are illustrated by what the pleadings in
the two cases show. In our case, the practical operation of
the agreement has been to continue the. same competition that
