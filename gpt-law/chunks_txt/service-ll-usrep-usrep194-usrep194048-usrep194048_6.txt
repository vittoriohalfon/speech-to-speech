court from exercising an authority not conferred upon it by

We proceed, therefore, to inquire whether the Circuit Court
could take cognizance of this case upon rembval from the
state court and make a final decree upon the merits.
Of course, the Circuit Court could not take cognizance of
the case as one presenting a controversy between citizens of
different States; for the State of Minnesota is not a citizen
within the meaning of the Constitution or the acts of Congress.

But the first section of the Judiciary Act of 1887-8, 24 Stat.
552, c. 373; 25 Stat. 433, c. 866, provides, among other things,
that the Circuit Courts of the United States may take original
cognizance of all suits of a civil nature at law or in equity,
arising under the Constitution or laws of the United- States,
where the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds in value
the sum of two thousand dollars. And the second section
provides for the removal from a state court of "any suit of a
civil nature, at law or in equity, arising under the Constitution
or laws of the United States . . . of which the Circuit
Courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction by
the preceding section."
In Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, 152 U. S. 454, 461,
which involved the scope and meaning'of the acts of 1887-8,
in respect of cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the
United States, this court, after referring to section one, said:
"But the corresponding clause in section 2 allows removals
from a state court to be made only by defendants, and of suits

original jurisdiction by the preceding section,' thus limiting
the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court of the United States on
removal by the defendant under this section to such suits as
might have been brought in that court by the plaintiff under the
first section. 24 Stat. 553; 25 Stat. 434. The change is in
accordance with the general policy of these acts, manifest upon
their face, and often recognized by this court, to contract the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of the United States." Mexi-
can Nat. Railroad v. Davidson, 157 U. S. 201, 208; Metcalf v.
Watertown, 128 U. S. 586. And in Chappell v. Walerworth,
155 U. S. 102, 107, the court, referring to Tennessee v. Union
& Planters' Bank, said that it was there adjudged, upon full
consideration, that, under the act of 1887-8, "a case (not
depending on the citizenship of the parties, nor otherwise
specially provided for,) cannot be removed from a state court
into the Circuit Court of the United States, as one arisingu nder
the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States, unless that
appears by the plaintiff's statement of his own claim; and that,
if it (toes not so appear, the want cannot be supplied by any
statement in the petition for removal, or, in the subsequent
pleadings." To the same effect are Postal Tel. Cable Co. v.
Alabama, 155 U. S. 482, 487; United States v. American Bell
Tel. Co., 159 U. S. 548, 553; Oregon Short Line v. Skottowe, 162
U. S. 490, 494; Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Cody, 166 U. S.
606, 608; Pratt v. Paris Gas Light & Coke Co., 168 U. S. 255,

Texas Coal Co., 183 U. S. 185; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Ann
Arbor Railroad Co., 178 U. S. 239. These cases establish,
beyond further question in this court, the rule that, under
existing statutes regulating the jurisdiction of the courts of the
United States, a case. cannot be removed from a state court,
as one arising under the Constitution or laws of the United
States, unless the plaintiff's complaint, bill or declaration
shows it to be a case Of that character. "If it does not appear
at the outset," this court has quite recently said, "that the
suit is one of which the Circuit Court at the time its jurisdiction

is invoked could properly take cognizance, the suit must be
dismissed." Third St. & Suburban Ry. v. Lewis, 173 U. S.
457, 460.
We must then inquire whether the complaint presents a ease
arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, in
respect of which the original jurisdiction of the Circuit Court
could have been invoked by the State.
The real purpose of the suit was to annul the agreement and
suppress the combination alleged to exist between the defend-
ant corporations upon the ground that such agreement and
combination were in violation, first, of the laws of Minnesota,
and, second, of the Anti-Trust Act of Congress. If relief had
been asked upon the ground alone that what the defendant
corporations had (lone and would, unless restrained, continue
to do, was forbidden by the statutes of Minnesota, the Circuit
Court of the United States could not have taken cognizance
.of the case; for confessedly such a controversy would not have
been one between citizens of different States, nor could such
a suit have been deemed one arising under the Constitution
or laws of the United States.
The contention, however, is that a case arising under the
laws of the United States was presented by the allegation in
the complaint that the combination and consolidation between
the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies
and. their control of their affairs and operations by the Northern
Securities Company, were also in violation of the Anti-Trust
Act of Congress of July 2, 1890. An allegation in a complaint
filed in a Circuit Court of the United States may, in(dee(d, in a
sense, confer jurisdiction to determine whether the case is of
the class of which the court may properly take cognizanee for
purposes of a final decree on the merits. Newburyport Water
Co. v. Newburyport, 193 U. S. 561, and Pacific Electric Ry. Co.
v. Los Angeles3, post, page 112, decided at present term. But if,
notwithstanding such an allegation, the court finds, at any
time, that the case does not really and substantially involve a
dispute or controversy within its jurisdiction then, by the
