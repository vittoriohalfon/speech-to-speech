Opinion of the Court.
roao companies as common carriers, was simplyj that all con-
tracts, whether in reasonable.as well as in unreasonable re-
straint of trade, were included in the terms of the act, and the
question whether the contract then under review was in fact
in restraint of trade in any degree whatever was neither made
nor decided, while it is plainly raised in this.
Again, it is asserted that there are differences between the
provisions contained in the two agreements, of such a ma-
terial and fundamental nature that the decision in the case
referred to ought to form no precedent for the decision of the
case now before the court.
It is also objected that tjhe statute, if construed dÂ§ it has
been construed in the Trans-Missouric ase, is unconstitutional,
in that it unduly interferes with the liberty of the individual
and takes away from him the right to make contracts regard-
ing his own affairs, which is guaranteed to 1im by the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that "no
pers6n shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty or property
without due process of law; nor shall private property be
taken for public use without just compensation." This objec-
tion was not advanced in the arguments in the other case.
Finally, a reconsideration of the questions decided in the
former case is very strongly pressed upon our attention, be-
cause, as is stated, the decision in that case is quite plainly
erroneous, and the -consequences of such error are far reach-
ing and disastrous, and. clearly at war with. justice and
sound policy, and the construction placed upon the Anti-Trust
statute has been received by the public with surprise and
alarm.
We will refer to these propositions in the order in which
they have been named.
As to the first, we think the report of the Trans-lfissouri
case clearly shows not only that the point now taken was
thereurged upon the attention of the court, but it was then
intentionally and necessarily decided. The whole foundation
of the case on the part of the Government was the allegation
that the agreementthere set forth was a contract or combina-
tion in restraint of trade, and unlawful on that account, If

had no case.
If-it did' not in any degree restrain trade, it was immaterial
whether the statute embraced all contracts in restraint of
trade, or only such as were in unreasonable restraint thereof.
There was no admission or concession in that case that the-
agreement did in fact restrain trade to a reasonable degree.
Hence, it was necessary to determine the fact as to the char-
acter of the agreement before the case was made out on the
part of the Government.
The great stress of the argfiment on both sides was un-
doubtedly upon the question as to the proper construction of
the statute, for that seemed to admit of the most doubt, but
the other question was before the court, was plainly raised,
and was necessarily decided. The opinion shows this to be-
true. At page 341 of the report the opinion contains the fol-
lowing language:
"The conclusion which we have drawn from the examina-
tion above made into the question before us is that the Anti-
Trust act applies to railroads, and that it renders illegal all
agreements which are in restraint of trade or commerce as we-
have above defined that expression, and the question then.
arises whether.the agreement before us is of that nature.
"Does the agreement restrain trade or commerce in any
way so as to be a violation of the act? We have no doubt-
that it does. The agreement on its face recites that it is
entered into for the purpose of mutual .protEction by establish-
ing and maintaining reasonable rates, rules and regulations on
all freight traffic, both through and local.
"To that end the association is foimed and a body created
which is to adopt rates which, when agreed to, are to be the.
governing rates for all the companies, and a violation of which
subjects the defaulting company to the payment of a penalty,
and although the parties have a right to withdraw from the
agreement on giving thirty days' notice of a desire so to do,
yet while in force and assuming it to be lived up to, there can
be no doubt that its direct, immediate and necessary effect is

to put a restraint upon trade or commerce as described in the
act. For these reasons the suit of the Government can be
maintained without proof of the allegation that the agreement
was entered into for the purpose of restraining trade or com-
merce or for maintaining rates above what was reasonable.
The necessary effect of the agreement is to restrain trade or
commerce, no matter what the intent was on the part of those
who signed it."
The bill of the complainants in that case, while alleging
an illegal and unlawful intent on the part of the railroad
companies in entering into the agreement, also alleged
that by means of the agreement the trade, traffic and com-
merce in the region of country affected by the agreement
had been and were monopolized and restrained, hindered,
injured and retarded. These allegations were denied by de-
fendants.
There was thus a clear issue made by the pleadings as to the
character of the agreement, whether it was or was not one in
restraint of trade.
The extract from the opinion of the court above given
shows that the issue so made was not ignored, nor was it
assumed as a concession that the agreement did restrain trade
to a reasonable extent. The statement in the opinion is quite
plain, and it inevitably leads to the conclusion that the ques-
tion of fact as to the necessary tendency of the agreement
was distinctly presented to the mind of the court, and was
consciously, purposely and necessarily decided. It cannot,
therefore, be correctly stated that the opinion only dealt with
the question of the construction of the act, and that it was
assumed that the agreement did to some reasonable extent
restrain trade. In discussing the question as to the proper
construction of the act, the court did not touch upon the other
aspect of the case, in regard to the nature of the agreement
itself, but when the question of construction was finished, the
opinion shows that the question as to the nature of the agree-
ment was then entered upon and discussed as a fact necessary
to be decided in the case, and that it in fact was decided. An
unlawful intent in entering into the agreement was held im-
