existed before. This is admitted. It has been to continue
the same just and reasonable rates previously established, and
to give a co6perative and advantageous service upon equal
terms to everybody and of equal benefit to the whole public.
The bill in the Trans-MAs8ouri case alleged- there. being, it
will be remembered, no previously established rates that were
agreed upon -that the parties had refused to establish and
give their customers just rates. The answer did not meet the
charge, but evaded it in the manner that the court will see
stated in my brief. The practical construction by parties to
contracts in their operations under them has always been con-
sidered an important element in determining the true character
and meaning of the contract. What I have now stated shows
the operating difference between the two contracts.
The next principal contention of my learned brother is that
Article VIII of the agreement violates the Trust act by re-
straining trade.
The words of the article are as follows:
"ARTICLE VIII.
"PROPORTIONS OF COMPETITIVE TRAFFIC.
"The 'anagers are charged with the duty of securing to
each company party hereto equitable proportions of the com-
petitive traffic covered by this agreement so far as can be
legally done."
This article provides that the managers shall endeavor so
far, and so far only, as obedience to law-that is to say,
conformity with the Commerce act and conformity with the
Trust act- would permit, to secure equitable proportions of
the competitive traffic to each one of the companies. It is a
sufficient answer to my brother's contention to say that the
very terms of the article do not require or invite or allow the
managers to act under it at all otherwise than as the law shall
permit. If, therefore, the Trust act condemns the effort re-
ferred to, then not to make the effort. If the Interstate Com-
merce act, either in terms or spirit, is adverse to such an effort
the managers are not authorized to take a step. Does it vio-
late the law to merely authorize an agent to do something in

the course of business so far, and so far only, as the law will
permit?
But I contend that it was in conformity with law that each
company should have an equitable proportion of the traffic.
What does equitable mean? It means that which right and
justice and the public interest require. What did justice and
public policy require? And what does it still require in respect
of the nine great lines connecting the western lakes and the
valley of the Mississippi and the whole continent beyond with
the Atlantic seaboard? Was it hot just and necessary to
public interest that each one of, these roads, passing through
great extents of country, and having along them populations
and interests to whose welfare the existence of each one of
these roads was *necessary, should be considered with refer-
ence to the othrough'traffic which should come from beyond?
The question answers itself. It is obvious, then, that just so
far as each road should be enabled to carry the through traffic
that naturally belonged to it, by just so far the people along
the whole length of its line would be benefited by increasing
the income of the line and thereby contributing to its support
and to its ability to make lower rates to all its people from
one end of the line to the other. This provision of the eighth
article then, I submit, -was wholesome, lawful and necessary,
and it was the very thing that one of the clauses in the Com-
merce act and the spirit of all its provisions required.
I may be allowed to say a word in respect of the objection
that no one of the roads could change its rates without giving
thirty days' notice, and therefore that this was a restraint of
trade, in one sense or another. It will be seen on examining
the agreement that each road had the absolute right, under
the agreement and pursuant to its provisions, to change its
own rates, and still continue a member of the association.
This being so, it seems to me impossible to contend that any
part of the agreement was any sort of restraint, unless it can
be established, that the thirty days' notice was too long. It
is a matter of history that when the Commerce act was
passed there was inserted in it the requirement that no rate
should be raised except on ten days' notice, and none should

be lowered except on three days' notice, publicly displayed.
What was the principle of this? It was that justice and fair
play to customers and to the public and to all persons directly
or indirectly interested in transportation required that suffi-
cient and timely knowledge of changes in rates which, as we
know, affect in a greater or less degree all commercial and
productive transactions, should be had by every person and
community interested. I suppose I may properly state it as
a public fact, now known to everybody engaged in business,
that the time fixed in the Commerce act for notice was much
too short, and that unjust inequalities have arisen, again and
again, from changes in rates by particular roads on such short
notice that favored customers and favored localities, etc., would
get advantages over others, in violation of the spirit and sub-
stance of the Commerce act. It was for the purpose, then,
and with the effect of producing the widest fair play and
equality among all persons, all roads and all communities,
that this period of thirty days instead of ten was agreed
upon. It was obviously right, and being right, it should not
be condemned, unless the rigor of a law that cannot be other-
wise construed and applied compels it.
I submit with sincere confidence, as it regards the provision
I have just spoken of, as well as it regards all the other pro-
visions of the contract, that, instead of being even a partial
restraint of trade, they are all provisions of constraint in sup-
port of and in promotion of trade. Trade is a general word,
and its operations, like all other operations that require co-
operating and associating forces and arrangement, are ad-
vanced by, and indeed, cannot be carried on truly.and honestly
for public interests without checks and regulations, some of
which may restrain and regulate the behaviorof a particular
element in the whole operation, and by doing so do not
restrain but advance and promote the whole; just as, to take
the simplest of illustrations that occurs to me, in mechanics,
the safety valve of a locomotive, with its counterweight, regu-
lates and restrains, or gives off, the accumulating steam in
the boiler, in the first place conserving it, restraining it from
escape, and in the second place, enabling it to escape. But all
