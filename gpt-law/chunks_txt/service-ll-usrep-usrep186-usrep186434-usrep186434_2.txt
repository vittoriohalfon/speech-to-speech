mand of any person, until such supposed holder or owner shall

ance of real estate or as a chattel mortgage, or to renew such

Many other provisions and cQnditions were contained in the
mortgage, which are not material to be mentioned.
Most of the moneys arising from the issuing of these bonds
were applied towards the construction of the plant of the mort-
gagor company at its place of business in the city of Irwin,
Pennsylvania. The company soon got into financial difficulties,
and about January, 1894, the defendant Kann became a stock-
holder therein and was elepted its treasurer. By March 19,
1894, the company had become involved in litigation, and was
very greatly embarrassed financially, and some of the other
officers of the company had. disagreements with Kann in regard

to his advances of money, so that on the day last named a bill
in equity was filed against the company, in the name of some
of its creditors and directors, in the Court ,of Common Pleas
of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, praying among other
things for the appointment of a receiver of the property of the
company, and for a decree winding up its busin6ss. In that
suit Joseph W. Stoner, the then secretary of the company, was
appointed receiver, and such proceedings were had therein that
on or about June 18, 1894, the court made an order for the
sale of all the property of the mortgagor company, and the same
was sold at public auction to defendant Kann for the sum of
$37,500, he being the highest bidder at the sale, which was open
and public, and attended by others who made bids on the prop-
erty. The sale was made subject to the mortgage to the com-
plainant, and a deed was given by the receiver, pursuant to the
order of the court, to Kann, the deed bearing date July 2, 1894,
and reciting that the property was thereby conveyed "subject to
a mortgage made by said Pennsylvania Plate Glass Company
to The Farmers' Loan and Trust Company of the State of New
York, dated first of January, 1891, recorded in Westmoreland
County, in mortgage book No. 43, page 1," and being the mort-
gage or deed of trust made to complainant as stated. Kann
continued in possession as owner of the property under this
deed from the receiver until about July 1, 1895, when he con-
veyed, by deed dated on that day, all of the mortgaged prop-
erty, together with the improvements made thereon by himself,
to the defendant, The Penn Plate Glass Company, for a con-
sideration named in the deed of $83,500. Kann in his evi-
dence says the consideration really amounted'to $118,000. The
deed from Kann to the company also recited that the property
therein conveyed was "subject to a mortgage made by said
Pennsylvania Plate Glass Company to The Farmers' Loan and
Trust Company of the State of New York, dated first of Jan-
uary, 1891, recorded in Westmoreland County, in mortgage
book No. 43, page 1-'
While Kann held the property he paid the interest on the
bonds, but default was made in the payment of the coupons
maturing on July 1, 1895, and no coupons have been paid since
that time.
