formity in the rates, fares, charges and rules established here-
under."
An injunction to construe and exercise powers conferred so
as to permit no violation of law, is an admission that the
powers may be so construed and exercised as to violate law.
If the anti-trust law prohibited only those contracts in un-
reasonable restraint of trade or commerce there might be
saving force in this section. But the anti-trust law prohibits
all contracts in restraint of trade or commerce. Whether
the rates be reasonable or unreasonable, an agreement pro-
viding for their establishment and maintenance by-a n associa-
tion of interstate railways, is prohibited. The managers can
exercise none of the essential powers conferred by the agree-
ment without violating the law. In the matter of the essen=
tial powers, it is not a question of method or degree; the
powers cannot be exercised, because they are in themselves
illegal. The association itself is illegal. It is formed for the
purpose of controlling certain competitive traffic. The cen-
tral authority - the managers- is given the power to estab-
lish and maintain rates on that traffi6. Take away from the
association the power to establish and maintain rates, and
it immediately falls to pieces.. It ceases to have a 'aison
e2tre.
The authority of the Government to maintain this suit is
sustained in United States v. Freight Association, 166 U. S.
290, 343, citing in re Debs, 158 U. S. 564 CC incinnati, New

There are certain observations in relation to the Anti-Trust
act which are properly to be made before proceeding to the
argument.
There is no doubt that prior to and at the time of the pas-

sage of this law there were, as there still are, certain ten-
dencies in the industrial world which drew widespread
attention and excited, in some' minds, much alarm. Many
industries were seen, or supposed, to be under the control of
great aggregations of capital, either in the hands of individ-
uals united under some form of agreement, partnership or
other, or contributed as the capital of corporate bodies. Some
of the most conspicuous were called by the vague name of
"trusts," and this term came to be employed, in a general way,
to designateoall of them. For obvious reasons, and quite aside
from the question whether their objects and effects are mis-
chievous or beneficial, such combinations of capital are not
popular, and the designation " trust" came to be a rather re-
proachful one.
Undoubtedly it may be possible for a large aggregated
capital to wield a greater power in many ways than would be
possible for the same amount distributed among many separate.
owners or managers, and the suspicion was entertained that
such power was employed in controlling markets, and perhaps.
in controlling legislatiofi, and it Was also thought to be an in-
strumentality by which -the unequal distributioi of wealth was
fostered and increased. The disfavor thus excited was, as was
natuial, turned to political account. Those opposed to a pro-
tective tariff charged upon its advocates that they were favor-
ing and stimulating trusts, and the latter felt the need of
repelling the charge by doing something to show that they
were the ddclared enemies of trusts.
Under such circumstances it was quite natural that schemes.

should be started, and any opposition to them would natu-
rally draw upon the authors of' it the r6proach. that they
-were the friends and, perhaps, the paid defenders, of these
powerful interests.
While, therefore, all, or nearly all, professed themselves in
favor of repressive legislation, the question *what legislation
could be contrived was a difficult one and suggested some
difficult questions. How'was a "trust" to be legally defined
so that a prohibition of it should not include a prohibition of'

the exercise of the clearest constitutional rights ? Congress,
surely, could not prevent the creation of corporations under
state laws, or limit the capacity of forming partnerships, or
in any manner interfere with the internal business of States.
And was it certain that these so called trusts were, in every
instance, necessarily mischievous? Indeed, sensible legislators
for the most part understood very clearly that the things com-
plained of were but the necessary incidents and consequences
of the progress of industry and civilization .and could not be
arrested without checking the advance of the nation and crip-
pling it in the fierce competitions with other nations, and that
any useful effort to remedy the supposed evils must be directed
against the abuses of the power of aggregated capital and not
at the aggregations themselves. Under these circumstances
Congress prbceeded very cautiously and enacted the only
measure which seemed possible without passing the plainest
constitutional limits. It did not attempt to define "trusts,"
or limit aggregations of capital in any form. The general
charge was that these combinations were in some form
monopolies, and in restraint of trade, but Congress did not
in the remotest degree attempt to define what a monopoly or
restraint of trade was. It was, however, perfectly safe to
declare that if these combinations did in any case create
monopolies, or restraints upon trade, they should be prohib-
ited from so doing in the future; and this is what Congress
did and all it did, by passing the act in question. It prohib-
ited contracts and combinations to create monopolies or re-
strain trade, and left it to the courts, without a word of
direction or instruction, to determine what contracts did
create monopolies or restrain trade, and what did not.
It cannot be said that Congress has done an unwise or im-
prudent thing, and that if calamity occurs the fault lies at
its doer. It has prohibited nothing but contracts and com-
binations to create restraints of trade and monopolies. These,
when properly defined, are, beyond question, public mischiefs
and ought to be prohibited. If any useful thing becomes
stricken down by the law, it must be the result of some
erroneous interpretation.
