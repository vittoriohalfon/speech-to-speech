from the others, sold to the Securities Company a large amount
of the capital stock of the Great Northern Company for the
price of $180 par value of the capital stock of the Securities
Company for each share of the capital stock of the Great North-
ern Company; that these defendants and other stockholders of
the Northern Pacific Company, each individually and sepa-
rately from the others, sold to the Securities Company a large
amount of the capital stock of the Northern Pacific Company;
that the Securities Company also offered, for a limited period,
like terms of. purchase to the other shareholders of the Great
Northern Company; that the Securities Company now holds
and owns a large majority of the capital stock of the Northern
Pacific Railway Company, and a large amount, though less
than a controlling interest, of the stock of the Great Northern
Company, and has negotiated for the purchase of additional
shares of that company, and that the Securities Company has
received such dividends as have been paid on any shares held
by it.

$75,000,000 were preferred and $80,000,000 common stock.
The preferred stock of the company was issued in exchange for
various obligations of the former Northern Pacific Railroad
Company because the holders thereof would not accept new
common stock therefor. At the same time it was contem-
plated that the time would arrive when said preferred stock
should properly be retired, and it was, accordingly, then pro-
vided that the preferred stock might be retired in whole or in
part at par on any first day of January, up to and including
January 1, 1917. Both classes of stock were made subject to
a voting trust in this defendant Morgan and others, continuing
until November 1, 1901, but terminable by the trustees in
their discretion at an earlier date.
The Northern Pacific Company shared in the recent pros-
perity of the country, and its common stock appreciated in
value until it was deemed practicable to carry out the original
intention of retiring the preferred stock and also to terminate
the voting trust. Accordingly said trust was terminated by the
trustees upon January 1, 1901, and the preferred stock was
retired. Although the latter action was in contemplation and
was practically decided upon some time before the termination
of the voting trust, it was not made the subject of formal action
by the board of directors until November 13, 1901, and was
completed upon January 1, 1902.
XV. As hereinbefore stated, early in 1901, the Northern
Pacific Company, and the Great Northern Company, each pur-
chased about 49 per cent of the capital stock of the Chicago,
Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company. This purchase was
made by the Northern Pacific Company primarily in order to
secure a terminus at Chicago and permanent connection with
the eastern and southeastern markets, which are especially
valuable for the agricultural and mineral products of the
northwest, but also because the Burlington system serves a
large and growing territory, and the purchase was deemed
desirable and profitable in itself.
These purchases were not made, as the petition alleges, "in

contemplation of the ultimate placing of the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific system under a common source of con-
trol." They had no connection whatever with the future
formation of the Northern Securities Company, or any other
company whatsoever, and had no connection with the fact
alleged in the petition that the Union Pacific Railway system
is to some extent a competing system with the Burlington
system.
The said purchases were not made with intent to violate the
statute or common law of any State or of the United States;
were not in violation of any such law, and are not charged in
the petition to have been in any respect unlawful.
XAI. During the reorganization of the Northern Pacific
system the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co., of which these defend-
ants are members, acted as reorganization managers, an(I ever
since the reorganization of the Northern Pacific Company has
been its fiscal agent. Said firm has accordingly at all times
desired to further the best interests of the company and all its
stockholders, and especially to aid in steadily devolopiig the
business of the company and the prosperity of the country
which it serves. Said firm considered that these results were
accomplished, so far as possible, by the policy of the company
during the existence of the voting trust, as above stated. Not
long after the termination of the voting trust, however, an(
very early in May, 1901, said firm became aware that unusually
large purchases of both classes of stock were in progress in the
stock market, apparently in a single interest. Said firm was
apprehensive that these purchases were for the purpose of
securing control of the direction of the Northern Pacific Com-
pany and thus managing it, not for what said firm conceived
to be the best interest of the company, but for some ulterior
purpose of which said firm was not informed.
Accordingly said firm, prior to Mray 7, 1901, purchased com-
mon stock of the Northern Pacific Company in consi(lerable
amounts, and their holdings upon that day amounted to about
two hundred thousand shares. In making these purchases said
