material., but only for the reason that the agreement did in-
fact and by its terms restrain trade.
Second. We have assumed that the agreements in the two
oases were substantially alike. This the respondents by no
means admit, and they assert that there are such material and
substantial differences in the provisions of the two instru-
ments as to necessitate a different result in this case from that
*a rrived at in the other.
The expressed purpose of the agreement in this case is,
among other things, "to establish and maintain reasonable
and just rates, fares, rules and regulations on state and inter-
state traffic." The companies agree that .the schedule of rates
and fares a ready duly published and in force .and authorized
by the companies, parties to the agreement, and filed, as to
interstate traffic, with the Interstate Commerce Commission,
shall be reaffirmed, and copies of all such schedules are to be
filed, with the managers constituted under the agreement,
within ten days after it becomes effective. The managers
may from time to time recommend changes in the rates, etc.,
and a failure to observe the recommendations is deemed a
violation of the agreement. No company can deviate from
these rates except under a resolution of its board of directors,
and such resolution can only take effect thirty days after
service of a copy thereof on the managers, who, upon receipt
thereof, "shall act promptly for the protection of the parties
hereto." For a violation of the'agreement the offending com-
pany forfeits to the association a sum to be determined by
the managers thereof, not exceeding five thousand dollars, or
more upon the contingency named in the rule..
So far as the establishment of rates and fares is concerned,
we do not see any substantial differ6nce between this agree-
ment. and the one set forth in the Tr'ans-Missouric ase. In
that case the rates were established by the agreement, and
any company violating the schedule of rates as established
under the agreement was liable to a penalty. A company
could withdraw from the association on giving -thirty days'
notice, but while it continued a member it was bound to
charge the rates fixed, under a penalty for not doing so. In

Opinion of the Court.
this case the companies are bound to charge the rates fixed
upon originally in the agreement or subsequently recommended
by the board of managers, and the failure to observe their
reconmendations is deemed a violation of the agreement. The
only alternative is the adoption of a resolution by the board
of directors of any company providing for a change of rates
so far as that company is boncerned, and the service of a copy
thereof upon the board of managers as already stated. This
provision for changing rates by any one company is absent
from the other agreement. It is this provision which is re-
ferred to by counsel as most material and important, and one
which constitutes a material and important distinction between
the two agreements. It is said to be designed solely to pre-
vent secret and illegal competition in rates, while at the same
time providing for and permitting open competition therein,
and that unless it can be regarded as restraining competition
so as to restrain trade, there is not even an appearance of
restraint of trade in the agreement. It is obvious, however,
that if such deviation from rates by any company from those
agreed upon, be tolerated, the principal object. of the associa-
tion fails of accomplishment, because the purpose of its forma-
tion is the establishment and maintenance of reasonable and
just rates and a general uniformity therein. If one company
is allowed, while remaining a member of the association, to
fix its own rates and be guided by them, it is plain that as
to that company the agreement might as well be rescinded.
This result was never contemplated. In order, therefore, not
only to prevent secret competition, but also to prevent any
competition whatever among the companies parties to the
agreement, the provision is therein made for the prompt
action of the board- of managers whenever it receives a copy
of the resolution adopted by the board of directors of any
one company for a change of the rates as established under
the agreement. By reason of this provision the board undoubt-
edly has authority and power to enforce the uniformity of
rates as against the offending company upon pain of an open,
rigorous and relentless "waro f competition against it on the part
of the whole association.

Opinion of the Court.
A company desirous of deviating from the rates agreed
upon and which its associates desire to maintain is at once con-
fronted with this probability of a war between itself on the
one side and the whole association on the other, in the course
of which rates would probably drop lower than the company
was proposing, and lower than it would desire or could afford,
and such a prospect would be generally sufficient to prevent
the inauguration of the change of rates and the consequent
competition. Thus the power to commence such a war on
the part of the managers would operate to most effectually
prevent a deviation from rates by any one company against
the desire of the other parties to the agreement: Competition
would be prevented by the fear of the united competition of
the association against the particular member. Counsel for the
association themselves state that the agreement makes it
the duty of the managers, in case the defection should inju-
riously affect some particular members more than others, to
endeavor to furnish reasonable protection to such members,
presumably by allowing them to change rates so as to meet
such competition, or by recommending such fierce competition
as to persuade the recalcitrant to fall back into line. By this
course the competition is open, but none the less sufficient on
that account, and the desired and expected result is to be the
yielding of the offending company, induced by the war which
might otherwise be waged against it by the combined force
of all the other parties to the agreement. Under these cir-
cumstances the agreement, taken as a whole, prevents, and
was evidently intended to prevent," not only secret but any
competition. The abstract right of a single company to
deviate from the'rates becomes immaterial, and its exercise,
to say the least, very inexpedient, in the face of this power of
the managers to enlist the whole association in a war upon it.
This is not all, however, for the agreement further provides
that the managers are to have power to organize such joint
freight and passenger agencies as they may deem desirable, and
if established they are to be so'arranged as to give proper repre-
sentation to each company, and no soliciting or contracting
passenger or freight agency can be maintained by any of the
