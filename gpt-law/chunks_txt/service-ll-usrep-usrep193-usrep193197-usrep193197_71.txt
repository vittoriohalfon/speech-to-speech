the statute forbids a combination of men into a corporation to
build and run such a railroad between the States.
I assume that the Minnesota charter of the Great Northern
and the Wisconsin charter of the Northern Pacific both are
valid. Suppose that, before either road was built, Minnesota,
as part of a system of transportation between the States, had
created a railroad company authorized singly to build all the
lines in the States now actually built, owned or controlled by
either of the two existing companies. I take it that that
charter would have been just as good as the present one, even
if the statutes which we are considering had been in force. In
whatever sense it would have created a monopoly the present
charter does. It would have been a large one, but the act of
Congress makes no discrimination according to size. Size has
nothing to do with the matter. A monopoly of "any- part"
of commerce among the States is unlawful. The supposed
company would have owned lines that might have been com-
peting-probably the present one does. But the act of Con-
gress will not be construed to mean the universal disintegra-
tion of society into single men,'each at war with all the rest,
or even the prevention of all further combinations for a com-
mon end.
There is a natural feeling that somehow or other the statute
meant to strike at combinations great enough to cause just
anxiety on the part of those who love their country more than
money, while it viewed such little ones as I have supposed
with just indifference. This notion, it may be said,.somehow
breathes from the pores of the act, although it seems to be con-
tradicted in every way by the words in detail. And it has oc-
curred to me that it might be that when a combination reached
a certain size it might have attributed to it more of the char-
acter of a monopoly merely by virtue of its size than would be
attributed to a smaller one. I am quite clear that it is only in
connection with monopolies that size could play any part. But
my answer has been indicated already. In the first place size in
the case of railroads is an inevitable incident and if it were an

objection under the act, the Great Northern and the Northern
Pacific already were too great and encountered the law. In
the next place in the case of railroads it is evident that the
size of the combination is reached for other ends than those
which would make them monopolies. The combinations are
not formed for the purpose of excluding others from the field.
Finally, even a small railroad will have the same tendency to
exclude others from its narrow area that great ones have to
exclude others from a greater one, and the statute attacks the
small monopolies as well as the great. The very words of the
act make such a distinction impossible in this case and it has
not been attempted in express terms.
If the charter which I have imagined above would have
been good notwithstanding the monopoly, in a popular sense,
which it created, one next is led to ask whether and why a
combination or consolidation of existing roads, although in ac-
tual competition, into one company of exactly the same powers
and extent, would be any more obnoxious to the law. Al-
though it was decided in Lo'i.ille & Nashville Railroad Co. v.
Kentucky, 161 U. S. 677, 701, that since the statute, as before,
the States have the power to regulate the matter, it was said,
in the argument, that such a consolidation would be unlawful,
and it seems to me that the Attorney General was compelled
to say so in order to maintain his case. But I think that logic
would not let him stop there, or short of lenying the power
of a State at the present time to authorize one company to con-
struct and own two parallel lines that might compete. The
monopoly would be the same as if the roads were consolidated
after they had begun t6 compete-and it is on the footing of
monopoly that I now am supposing the objection made. But
to meet the objection to the prevention of competition at the
same time, I will suppose that three parties apply to a State
for charters; one for each of two new and possibly competing
lines respectively, and one for both of these lines, and that the
charter is granted to the last. I think that charter would be
good, and I think the whole argument to the contrary rests

on a popular instead of an accurate and legal conception of
what the word "monopolize" in the statute means. I repeat,
that in my opinion there is no attempt to monopolize, and
what, as I have said, in my judgment amounts to the same
thing, that there is no combination in restraint of trade, until
something is done with the intent to exclude strangers to the
combination from competing with it in some part of the busi-
ness which it carries on.
Unless I am entirely wrong in my understanding of what a
"combination in restraint of trade" means, then the same
monopoly may be attempted and effected by an individual,
and is made equally illegal in that case by ยง 2. But I do not
expect to hear it maintained that Mr. Morgan could be sent
to prison for buying as many shares as he liked of the Great
Northern and the Northern Pacific, even if he bought them
both at the same time and got more than half the stock of
each road.
There is much that was mentioned in argument which I
pass by. But in view of the great importance attached by
both sides to the supposed attempt to suppress competition, I
must say a word more abolit that. I said at the outset that I
should assume, and I do assume, that one purpose of the pur-
chase was to suppress competition between the two roads. I
appreciate the force of the argument that there are independ-
ent stockholders in each; that it cannot be presumed that the
respective boards of directors will propose any illegal act;
that if they should they could be restrained, and that all that
has been done as yet is too remote from the illegal result to
be classed even as an attempt. Not every act done in further-
ance of an unlawful end is in attempt or contrary to the law.
There must be a certain nearness to the result. It is a question
of proximity and decree. Commonwealth v. Peaslee, 177 Massa-
chusetts, 267, 272. So, as I have said, is the amenability of acts
in furtherance of interference with commerce among the States
to legislation by Congress. So, according. to the intimation of
this court, is the question of liability under the present stat-
