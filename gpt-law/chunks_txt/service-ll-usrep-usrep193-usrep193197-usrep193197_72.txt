OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
HoLvcEs, J., The CHIEF JUsTICE, WIuTE, PECKUIAM, JJ., dissenting. 193 V. 9.
ute. Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578; Anderson v.
United States, 171 U. S. 604. But I assume further, for the
purposes of discussion, that what has been done is near enough
to the result to fall under the law, if the law prohibits that
result, although that assumption very nearly if not quite con-
tradicts the decision in United States v. B. C. Knight Co., 156
U. S. 1. But I say that the law does not prohibit the result..
If it does it must be because there is some further meaning
than I have yet discovered in the words "combinations in re-
straint of trade." I think that, I have exhausted the meaning
of those words in what I already have said. But they cer-
tainly do not require all existing competitions to be kept on
foot, and, on the principle of the Trans-Missouri Freight As-
sociation's case, invalidate the continuance of old contracts by
which former competitors united in the past.
A partnership is not a contract or combination in restraint
of trade between the partners unless the well known words are
to be given a new meaning invented for the purposes of this act.
It is true that the suppression of competition was referred to in
United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, 166 UT. S.
290, but, as I have said, that was in connection with a contract
with a stranger to the defendant's business-a true contract
in restraint of trade. To suppress competition in that way is
one thing, to suppress it by fusion is another. The law, I re-
peat, says nothing about competition, and only prevents its
suppression by contracts or combinations in restraint of trade,
and such contracts or combinations derive their character as
restraining trade from other features than the suppression of
competition alone. To see whether I am wrong, the illustra-
tions put in the argument are of use. If I am, then a partner-
ship between two stage drivers who had been competitors in
driving across a state line, or two merchants once engaged in
rival commerce among the States whether made after or be-
fore the act, if now continued, is a crime. For, again I repeat.,
if the restraint on the freedom of the members of a combina-
tion caused by their entering into partnership is a restraint of
