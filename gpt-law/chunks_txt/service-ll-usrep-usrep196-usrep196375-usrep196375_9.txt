196 U. S. Opinion of the Court.
they do so, with only the interruption necessary to find a
purchaser at the stock yards, and when this is a typical, con-
stantly recurring course, the current thus existing is a current
of commerce among the States, and the purchase of the cattle
is a part and incident of such commerce. What we say is true
at least of such a purchase by residents in another State from
that of the seller and of the cattle. And we need not trouble
ourselves at this tine as to whether the statute could be
escaped by any arrangement as to the place where the sale in
point of law is consummated. See Norfolk & Western Ry. v.
Sims, 191 U. S. 441. But the sixth section of the bill charges
an interference with such sales, a restraint of the parties by
mutual contract and a combination not to compete in order
to monopolize. It is immaterial if the section also embraces
domestic transactions.
It should be added that the cattle in the stock yard are not
at rest even to the extent that was held sufficient to warrant
taxation in Amercan Steel & Wire Co. v Speed, 192 U. S. 500.
But it may be that the question of taxation does not depend
upon whether the article taxed may or may not be said to be
in the course of commerce between the States, but depends
upon whether the tax so far affects that commerce as to
amount to a regulation of it. The injunction against taking
part in a combination, the effect of which will be a restraint
of trade among the States by directing the defendants' agents
to refrain from bidding against one another at the sales of live
stock, is justified so far as the subject matter is concerned.
The injunction, however, refers not to trade among the
States in cattle, concerning which there can be no question of
original packages, but to trade in fresh meats, as the trade
forbidden to be restrained, and it is objected that the trade in
fresh meats described in the second and third sections of the
bill is not commerce among the States, because the meat is
sold at the slaughtering places, or when sold elsewhere may
be sold in less than the original packages. But the allegations
of the second section, even if they import a technical passing

Opinion of the Court. 196 U. S.
of title at the slaughtering places, also import that the sales
are to persons in othr States, and that the shipments to other
States are part of thy transaction--" pursuant to such sales"-
and the third section imports that the same things which are
sent to agents are sol by them, and sufficiently indicates that
some at least of the sales are of the original packages. More:
over, the sales are by persons in one State to persons in another.
But we do not mean to imply that the rule which marks the
point at which state taxation or regulation becomes per-
missible necessarily is beyond the scope of interference by
Congress in cases where such interference is deemed necessary
for the protection of commerce among the States. Nor do we
mean to intimate that the statute under consideration is
limited to that point. Beyond what we have said above, we
leave those questions as we find them. They were touched
upon in the Northern Securites Company's Case, .193 U S. 197
We are of opinion, further, that the charge in the sixth sec-
tion is not too vague. The charge is not of a single agreement
but of a course of conduct intended to be continued. Under
the act it is the duty of the court, when applied to, to stop the
conduct. The thing (lone and intended to be done is perfectly
definite: with the purpose mentioned, directing the defendants'
agents and inducing each other to refrain from competition in
bids. The defendants cannot be ordered to compete, but they
properly can be forbidden to give directions or to make agree-
ments not to compete. See Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v
United States, 175 U S. 211. The injunction follows the charge.
No objection was made on the ground that it is not confined
to the places specified in the bill. It seems to us, however,
that it ought to set forth more exactly the transactions m
which such directions and agreements are forbidden. The
trade in fresh meat referred to should be defined somewhat
as it is in the bill, and the sales of stock should be confined to
sales of stock at the stock yards named, which stock is sent
from other States to the stock yards for sale or is bought at
those yards for transport to another State.

196 U. S. Opinon of the Court.
After what we have said, the seventh, eighth and ninth sec-
tions need no special remark, except that the cartage referred
to in section nine is not an independent matter, such as was
dealt with in Pennsylvana R. R. Co. v Knzght, 192 U S. 21,
but a part of the contemplated transit-cartage for delivery
of the goods. The general words of the injunction "or by
any other method or device, the purpose and effect of which
is to restrain commerce as aforesaid," should be stricken out.
The defendants ought to be informed as accurately as the case
permits what they are forbidden to do. Specific devices are
mentioned in the bill, and they stand prohibited. The words
quoted are a sweeping injunction to obey the law, and are
open to the objection which we stated at the beginning that
it was our duty to avoid. To the same end of definiteness so
far as attainable, the words "as charged in the bill," should
be inserted between "dealers in such meats," and "the effect
of which rules," and two lines lower, as to charges for cartage,
the same words should be inserted between "dealers and con-
sumers" and "the effect of which."
The acts charged in the tenth section, apart from the com-
bination and the intent, may, perhaps, not necessarily be
unlawful, except for the adjective which proclaims them so.
At least we may assume, for purposes of decision, that they
are not unlawful. The defendants, severally, lawfully may ob-
tain less than the regular rates for transportation if the cir-
cumstances are not substantially similar to those for which
the regular rates are fixed. Act of Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, ยง 2,
24 Stat. 379. It may be that the regular rates are fixed for
carriage in cars furnished by the railroad companies, and that
the defendants furnish their own cars and other necessities of
transportation. We see nothing to hinder them from com-
bining to that end. We agree, as we already have said, that
such a combination may be unlawful as part of the general
scheme set forth in the bill, and that this scheme as a whole
might be enjoined. Whether this particular combination can
be enjoined, as it is, apart from its connection with the other
