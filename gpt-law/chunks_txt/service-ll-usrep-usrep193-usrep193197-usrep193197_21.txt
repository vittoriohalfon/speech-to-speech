the Northern Securities Company from making such transfer
and assignments of the stock aforesaid to such person or
persons as may now be the holders and owners of its own
stock originally issued in exchange or in payment for the
stock claimed to have been acquired by it in the aforesaid
railway companies.
"It is further ordered and adjudged that the United States
recover from the defendants its costs herein expended, the
same to be taxed by the clerk of this court, and have execution
therefor."
Mr. George B. Young for appellants argued and presented
in a brief the following summary of the facts:
1. For some years prior to 1901 the two railway companies
had been engaged in an enterprise of building up a great in-
terstate and Oriental commerce.
2. In April, 1901, they purchased nearly all the Burlington
shares at a cost of over $200,000,000, paying for them with
their joint bonds, and not with the bonds of the Burlington
as stated in the decision of the lower court. They made the
purchase not with any view of placing the two companies,
their shares or their commerce, under a single control.
3. Immediately after this purchase, persons interested, in
the Union Pacific attempted to obtain the stock control of the;
Northern Pacific, their object being to prevent the carrying
out of the enterprise of the defendant railway companies, and
especially to prevent the use of the Burlington road in carry-
ing out that enterprise.
4. This " raid" (as it is called) on the Northern Pacific stock
failed, the failure being largely due to an error of the raiders
in buying common instead of preferred stock. But there was
imminent danger that another like attempt might be made
and be successful.
5. Such a raid, if successful, would destroy the commerce
the railway companies were building up, and in aid of which
they had bought the Burlington shares.

OCTOBFR TERM, 1903.
Argument of Mr. Young for Appellants. 1'93 U. S.
6. For some years prior to 1901, Mr. Hill and ten other
shareholders in the Great Northern Co., holding less than 30
per cent of its stock had contemplated the formation of a
company to which they should make absolute transfers of their
shares in consideration of the shares of such new company.
Their purpose was that the shares should be voted alike in
the future as they had been in the past, and that they should
fare alike in any sale of them that might be made.
7. In June, 1901, after the defeat of the raid, it was first
suggested that the proposed company should be enlarged so
as to include the Northern Pacific common stock (about
$21,000,000) held by the same persons, and later the plan was
still further widened so as to include the Northern Pacific
common stock (about $20,000,000) held by J. P. Morgan &
Co. should they desire to make such disposition of the stock
held by them.
8. It had all along been the purpose of Mr. Hill and his ten
associates that every shareholder in the Great Northern Co.
should be given an opportunity to join the company as orig-
inally planned,-this not because they needed or desired the
accession of such other shareholders, but to avoid any com-
plaint of unfair treatment on their part.
Q. This purpose was carried into the enlarged project, and
at the instance of Mr. Morgan, the same opportunity was to
be given to holders of Northern Pacific stock. And like the
company originally projected, the enlarged company was to be
authorized and was expected to acquire shares in coal mines
and in industrial enterprises of utility to the railways, but.
whose stock the railway companies could not hold, and also
to be a financial as well as an investment company, with
power in that capacity to aid the operations of the railway
companies, or of any other companies whose shares or securi-
ties it might hold.
10. The amount of Great Northern stock held by Mr. Hill
and his ten associates was from 33 to 35 millions out of a
total capital of $125,000,000. In 1896, they had severally

acquired $29,000,000 of Northern Pacific common stock, which
amount had, on May 1, 1901, been reduced by sales to
$20,000,000.
11. In forming the Northern Securities Co. it was the inten-
tion of its promoters that it should acquire, if it could, a ma-
jority of Northern Pacific stock, thereby protecting such stock
from future raids, and protecting the commerce of the rail-
ways from the ruin that would result from a successful raid.
They did not desire or expect that the Securities Co. should
acquire a majority of Great Northern shares. Such acquisi-
tion was not deemed necessary for the protection of the stock
of that company or of the commerce of the roads.
12. While the capitalization of the Securities Co. is nearly,
it is not (as stated in the opinion) the exact amount required
to pay for all the shares of the two railway companies at the
prices ($180 for Great Northern and $115 for Northern Pa-
cific) fixed for such exchanges.
13. Mr. Hill and his ten associates who promoted the Securi-
ties Co. did not agree or bind themselves even to transfer
their own shares to the Securities Co. Each of them was
left to decide for himself. Mr. Hill retained between two
and three millions of his shares.
And neither they, nor any one concerned in promoting the
Securities Co., nor J. P. Morgan & Co. ever agreed in any
manner that upon the organization of the Securities Co. they
would "use their influence to induce other stockholders in
their respective companies to do likewise," as erroneously
stated in the decision of the lower court.
14. The Securities Co. is not a railway company and has no
power to build or operate railways. Its powers are limited to
buying, selling and holding stocks, bonds and other securities,
with power to aid in any manner any company whose stock
or bonds it may hold, and to do all acts designed to aid any
company whose shares or securities it may hold, and protect
or enhance the value of its investment; also to hold any real
or personal property required for the transaction of its business.
