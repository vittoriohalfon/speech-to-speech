Argument for Appellees. 194 U. S.
Pacific v. Atchison R. R., 112 U. S. 414; Pacific Railroad Re-
moval Cases, 115 U. S. 1; Starin v. New York, 115 U. S. 2-
257; Southern Pacific R. Co. v. California, 118 U. S. 109, 112.
Metcalf v. Watertown, 128 U. S. 586; Shreveport v. Cole,
129 U. S 36, 41; Beck v. Perkins, 139 U. S. 628. In the
act of 1887-8, Congress used the same terms as in the act of
1875, in the same sense and reenacted them as thus con-
strued.
And this court has never intimated that the criterion de-
clared by Chief Justice Marshall and adopted and applied by
itself in so'many cases-was erroneous in itself or had been
rendered inapplicable to any class of cases by the amending
act of 1887-8. The following cases originated after the latter
act: Cooke v. Avery, 147 U. S. 375, 384; Colorado Central
Mining Co. v. Turck, 150 U. S.1 38, 143; Blackburn v. Portland
Gold Mining Co., 175 U. S.5 71, 580; Patton v. Brady, 184 U. S.
608, 611; Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U. S. 487, 494; Northern
Pacific Ry. Co. v. Soderberg, 188 U. S. 526.
As it' is the proper function of the plaintiff's pleading to
state his own case and not that of the defendant, to give juris-
diction the Federal question must appear in plaintiff's state-
ment of his own case, or of his own claim, and that is all that
is required.
In a few cases there are expressions-inadvertent, no doubt
-to the effect that the plaintiff's declaration must show that
he asserts a right under- the Constitution or some law of the
United States,-as if only such suits were suits arising under
the United States Constitution or laws. But this is directly
opposed to the cases already cited and others that will be cited.
If such a requirement were essential to jurisdiction, one
whose property was wrongfully seized by a United States
marshal or revenue collector, or whose property was taken
or his person or property injured by a Federal railway corpo-
ration, could have no redress in the Federal courts. His right
of property or of personal security is not derived from the
United States Constitution or laws, and when he asserts either

in a declaration he is not asserting a right under the United
States Constitution or laws.
For trespass against a marshal, see Bock v. Perkins, 139
U. S. 628; Sonnentheil v. Brewing Co., 172 U. S. 401. And
compare Walker v. Collins, 167 U. S. 57. Against an internal
revenue collector, see Venable v. Richards, 105 U. S. 636;
Harding v. Woodcock, 137 U. S. 43.
The bill presents Federal questions both in its aspect of a
bill by the State as a sovereign to enforce its local statutes,
and as-a landowner and shipper for relief under those statutes.
And these questions are the same whether the State sues as
sovereign or as property owner and shipper or in both 6f these
capacities.
For cases analogous to the one at bar, see South .Carolinav .
Coosaw Mining Co., 45 Fed. Rep. 804; 47 Fed. Rep. 225; 144
U. S. 550, cited with approval in In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564;
Ames v. Kansas, 111 U. S. 449; Hardingv . Woodcock, 137 U. S.
43; South Carolina v. Port Royal &c.. Ry. Co., 56 Fed. Rep.
333; People v. Rock Island &c. Ry. Co., 71 Fed. Rep. 753;
Minnesota v. Duluth &c. Ry. Co., 87 Fed. Rep. 497; Tennessee
v. Union Bank, 152 U. S. 454.
The cause was properly removed because of the plaintiff's
assertion of-right and claim of relief under the Constitution
and laws of the United States.
Besides the claims of the State under the full faith and
credit clause of Article IV of the Constitution, and its claim
under the swamp land granting acts of Congress, the State
asserts a right as a property owner and as engaged in interstate
commerce to carry on that commerce free from obstruction
by combinations in restraint of commerce or by monopolies of
such commerce-substantially the same right as that asserted
by the United States in the Debs Case, 158 U. S. 564, 583. A
citizen's right to carry on interstate commerce is a constitu-
tional right. Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S. 47, 57; Reid v.
Colorado, 187 U. S. 137. And there can be no doubt that a.
State has the same right as a citizen.

Opinion of the Court. 194 U. S.
The bill plainly asserts a right under the Constitution as well
as under the Anti-Trust Act, an(t this gives jurisdiction.
Whether the bill sufficiently alleges continuous or threatened
injury to that right to make a case for the relief prayed or for
any equitable relief is not a question of juris(iction, but a
question for the court to decide in the exercise of jurisdiction.
Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U. S. 487, 493; Southern Pacific
R. Co. v. California, 118 U. S. 112; Hax v. Caspar, 31 Fed.
Rep. 499; Lowry v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 46 Fed. Rep. 83.
The Circuit Court in a case like this, upon acquiring juris-
diction of the cause by reason of the Federal questions pre-
sented by the bill on the constitutionality of the state legisla-
tion and on the claim of rights under the Constitution and
laws, has jurisdiction to decide, not only these Federal ques-
tions, but every question, Federal or non-Federal, that may
be presented by the bill or arise upon the other pleadings or
the evidence. Osborn v. Bank of United States, supra. It
may decide the cause on these non-Federal grounds, without
deciding or even considering the Federal questions presented
by the bill. And this is the proper course where the Federal
questions are constitutional questions. Santa Clara Co. v.
Southern Pacific R. R., 118 U. S. 394, 410. Its jurisdiction
remains the same although the plaintiff should fail to estab-
lish by proofs the facts alleged as showing a right under the
Constitution or laws or otherwise raising a Federal question,
for the jurisdiction is determined by the averments of the
bill. Southern Pacific R. Co. v. California, 118 U. S. 109, 112;
City Ry. Co. v. Citizens R. R. Co., 166 U. S. 537, 562.
And the fact that the Federal questions may receive little
or no attention in the argument in this court, or even in the
Circuit Court, does not affect the jurisdiction of either court.
It may pass by the questions argued and decide the Federal
questions.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.
By a statute of Minnesota passed March 9, 1874, it was pro-
