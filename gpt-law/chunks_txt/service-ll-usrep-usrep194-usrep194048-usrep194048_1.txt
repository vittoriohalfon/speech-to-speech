MINNESOTA v. NORTHERN SECURITIES COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.
Nlo. 433. Argued January 7, 8, 1904.-Decided April 11, 1904.
Consent of parties can never confer jurisdiction upon a Federal court. If
the record does not affirmatively show jurisdiction in the Circuit Court,
this court must, upon its own motion, so declare, and make such order as
will prevent the Circuit Court from exercising an authority not conferred
upon it by statute.
A State is not a citizen within the meaning of the provisions of the Constitu-
tion or acts of Congress regulating the jurisd iction of the Federal courts.
Under existing statutes regulating the jurisdiction of the courts of the
United States, a case cannot be removed from a state court, as one arising
under the Constitution or laws of the United States, unless the plaintiff's
complaint, bill or declaration shows it to be a case of that character.
While an allegation in a complaint filed in a Circuit Court of the United States
may confer jurisdiction to dbtermine whether the case is of the class of
which the court may properly take cognizance for purposes of a final de-
cree on the merits, if, notwithstanding such allegation, the court finds,
at any time, that the case does nt really and substantially involve a dis-
pute or controversy within its jurisdiction then, by the express command
of the act of 1875, its duty is to proceed no further. And if the suit, as
disclosed by the complaint could not have been brought by plaintiff
originally in the Circuit Court, then, under the act of 1887-1888 it should
not have been removed from the state court and should be remanded.
The intention of the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 209, was to
limit direct proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations
of the Anti-Trust Act as cause injury to the general public, or to all alike,
merely from the suppression of competition in trade and commerce among
the several States and with foreign nations, to those instituted in the
name of the United States, under ยง 4 of the act, by District Attorneys
of the United States, acting under the direction of the Attorney General;
thus securing the enforcement of the act, so far as such direct proceedings
in equity are concerned, according to some unifcrm plan, operative
throughout the entire country.
A State cannot maintain an action in equity to restrain a corporation from
violating the provisions of the act of July 2, 1890, on the ground that such
violations by decreasing competition would depreciate the value of its
public lands and enhance the cost of maintaining its public institutions,
the damages resulting from such violations being remote and indirect and
not such direct actual injury as is providedfor in ยง 7 of the act.

MINNESOTA v. NORTHERN SECURITIES CO.
194 U. S. Argument for Appellant.
Article IV of the Constitution of the United States only prescribes a rule by
which courts, Federal and state, are to be guided when a question arises
in the progress of a pending suit as to the faith and credit to be given by
the court to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of a State,
other than that in which the court is sitting. It has nothing to do with
the conduct of individuals or corporations.
TiIE facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. 1f. B. Douglas, Attorney General of the State of Min-
nesota, and Mr. M. D.M unn, with whom Mr. George P. Wil-
son was on the brief, for appellant:
As to removal to and jurisdiction of the Circuit Court:
The action was removed on the joint petition of all the de-
fendants, on the ground that it arose under the Constitution
and laws of the United States, and that the right upon which
it was based and on which a recovery by plaintiff depended,
would be defeated by one-construction of the Constitution or
said laws, and sustained by an opposite construction. Diverse
citizenship did not form a basis for such removal, Postal Tele-
graph Cable Co. v. Alabama, 155 U. S. 482, and could not
rightfully be presented as a ground therefor.
As to the doing of business by the Northern Securities
Company within Minnesota and attempt to vacate service of
summons, see Goldey v. Morning News Co., 156 U. S. 518;
Wabash TWestern Railway v. Brow, 164 U. S. 271.
The Circuit Court has jurisdiction of all civil actions in part
arising under or depending upon the construction of the Con-
stitution, laws or treaties of the United States. 24 Stat. 552;
25 Stat. 433; Postal Tel. Cable Co. v. Alabama, 155 U. S. 482;
Ames v. Kansas, 111 U. S. 462; Gold-Washing and Water Co.
v. Keyes, 96 U. S. 203; Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177
U. S.5 07; Cummings v. Chicago, 188 U. S.4 10.
Read int'h e light of section 5 of the Court of Appeals Act-
chap. 517 of the laws of 1891-it is equally clear that juris-
diction is assumed to exist in the Circuit Courts and an appeal
authorized "in any case that involves the construction or
application of the Constitution of the United States."

Argument for Appellant. 194 U. S.
The Supreme Court of the United States is without original
jurisdiction of this controversy. Minnesota v. Northern Se-
curities Co., 184 U. S. 199.
Assuming the facts to be as stated in the affidavit of the
president of the Securities Company, above referred to,, to the
effect that the Securities Company is not the owner of any
property situated in Minnesota and never transacted any
business therein, the courts of Minnesota cannot acquire juris-
diction to hear and determine the issues involved herein, a
jurisdiction over the person of the Securities Company cannot
be obtained. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714; St. Clair v. Cox,.
.106 U. S. 350; Goldey v. Morning News Co., 156 U. S. 518;
Barrow Steamship, Co. v. Kane, 170 U. S. 100; Cabanne v.
Graf, 87 Minnesota, 510; Conley v. Matheson Alkely Works,
190 U. S. 406.
The Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railway com-
panies are necessary parties with the Securities Company, and
being residents of different States and not engaged in doing
business in any single State, jurisdiction of the person of all
the defendants cannot 'be obtained elsewhere than in this
court, in which the Securities Company has voluntarily ap-
peared. Minnesota v. Northern Securities Company, supra.
Under California v. Southern Pacific Ry. Co., 157 U. S. 270,
and Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., unless a Federal
question is deemed to exist in this record which gives to they'
Circuit Court jurisdiction over the subject matter of the ac-
tion, under our dual form of government, a State will be de-
prived of the right to invoke the jurisdiction, of any court in
the land for the purpose Of enforcing its laws or protecting its
proprietary interests from unlawful acts done in violation of
the laws of the State or Nation.
Two Federal questions are clearly set forth in appellant's
bill of complaint. Whether the State to protect its proprietary
interests had a cause of action against the defendants arising
in part aider the Federal Anti-Trust Act; and whether the
state Anti-Consolidation and Anti-Trust Acts (rightly con-
