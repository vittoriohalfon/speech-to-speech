the Pacific coast. These connections and such interchange of
traffic were deemed to be and are indispensable to the mainte-
nance of their business, local as well as interstate, and to the
development of the country served by their respective lines,
and of like advantage to the Burlington lines and the country
served by them, and strengthen each company in the competi-
tion with the more southerly lines to the Pacific coast, with the
Canadian Pacific Railway, and with European carriers, for the
trade and commerce of the Orient.
In such purchase there was no purpose to lessen any compe-
tition of the Burlington lines with those of either of the pur-
chasers, for they are not competitive, or to lessen any competi-
tion between the purchasers. Such purchase was not intended
to have, and it cannot have, any such effect.
The purchase of the Burlington stock was not made in view
of the formation of this defendant, but solely from the motives
and with the purposes already stated.
II. The project of forming a holding company of any kind was
not the result, in any way, of the failure of the plan which was,
defeated by the decision of the Supreme Court in the Pearsall
case. There was no connection whatever between the two.
The project of a holding company which finally developed
into the formation of this defendant had its inception years
before that date, among several gentlemen, not exceeding ten in
number, who had been large shareholders in the Great Northern
Company and its predecessor, the St. Paul, Minneapolis and
Manitoba Railway Company; some of them from the original
organization of the latter company in 1879, and others from
dates not long after that time. They have never held a major-
ity of ihe stock of the Great Northern Company, but have taken
an active interest in its policy and administration; have aided
it when necessary in financing its operations; have acted to-
gether in promoting its interests; have, with some exceptions,
served from time to time as directors and officers (Mr. Hill
having been president of the successive companies since 1882);
and by reason of their active interest in the company and serv-

ices to it have influenced to a large degree its policy and
management. As far back as 1893, most of these gentlemen
being well advanced and some far advanced in years, they
began to discuss together what would be the effect upon the
policy which under their influence the company had pursued
with great benefit to its shareholders and the public, should
their holdings by death or otherwise become scattered, and by
what means their holdings could be kept together, so as to
secure the continuance of such policy in the management of
the company. It was considered that if a. company should be
formed to which they might transfer their individual holdings,
their shares were likely to be held together, so long as the
majority in the holding company should so wish, and this would
tend to give stability to the policy of the Great Northern Com-
pany, be of aid to it in financial"operations, and maintain the
value of their investments. These conclusions were the result
of various consultations among the persons mentioned, or sone
of them, but no definite agreement was made for forming such
a company or binding anyone to transfer his shares to it if
formed.
From time to time, beginning with the reorganization of
the Northern Pacific Company in 1896, Mr. Hill and said other
Great Northern shareholders who had discussed with him the
plan of forming a holding company, had made large pur-
chases of Northern Pacific shares, individually, each for him-
self, without any concerted action, and solely as investments.
About May 1, 1901, their aggregate holdings of the common
stock of the Northern Pacific Company amounted to nearly
twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) of the eighty million dol-
lars (880,000,000) common stock of the company, which also
had a preferred stock, amounting to seventy-five million dollars
($75,000,000), with the same voting power as the comnmon
stock. At this time the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co. held about
six million dollars (.6,000,000) of the common stock. In the
fall of 1900 Mr. Hill and said Great Northern shareholders
discussed the question of putting their holdings of Northern

Pacific stock into the proposed holding company, as well as the
suggestion that all the other stockholders of the Great Northern
Company should be given the opportunity of selling and trans-
ferring their shares to the holding company, and that its capital
stock should be made large enough to enable it to buy such
holdings, though it was not known that the holders of any
considerable amount of Great Northern stock, other than those
above named, would desire to make such transfer.
At the time of the purchase of the Burlington shares it was
not contemplated by either purchasing company or its share-
holders that any alliance between the purchasing companies,
or among their shareholders, was needed to preserve to each
company its fair share of the advantages secured by the pur-
chase. It was thought that the manifest interest of each com-
pany rendered any further guaranty or security needless. But
pending or just after the conclusion of the negotiations for the
Burlington stock, parties acting in the interest of the Union
Pacific Railway system did purchase Northern Pacific shares,
both common and preferred, to the amount of about seventy-
eight million dollars ($78,000,000), being a clear majority of the
entire capital stock of that company. The apparent intent of
such purchase was to defeat and, if successful, it would have
defeated, the carrying out of the purposes for which the Bur-
lington shares had been bought by the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific companies, and the development of the inter-
state and international commerce of each of them, and would
have subordinated the policy of each to an interest adverse to
both the Great Northern and Northern Pacific companies, and
to the public served by their lines.
To protect the interests of the shareholders of the Northern
Pacific Company, J. P. Morgan & Co. made additional pur-
chases of Northern Pacific common stock, which, with the
holdings in said stock of Mr. Hill and other Great Northern
shareholders who had discussed with him the plan of forming a
holding company, constituted about forty-two million dollars
($42,000,000), being a majority of the common stock. In
