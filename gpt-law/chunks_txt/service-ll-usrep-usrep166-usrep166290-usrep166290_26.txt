On the subject of relative rates, the commission at page 39
of their first, annual report said: "Questions of rates- on one
line or at one. point cannot be considered by themselves ex-
clusively ; a change in them may affect rates in a considerable
part of the country. . . . Just rates are always relative;
the act itself provides for its being so when it forbids unjust
discrimination as between localities." That is to say, if one
continuous line made joint rates and fixed and published them,
and the other then made a different rate, not only would the
first joint rate be injurious to the interests of the railroads
making it, during the period in which it could not be changed,
but would also be against the interests of the public and of
those who had contracted to ship, since it would create among
shippers and the receivers that inequality which it was the
express purpose of the act to prevent.
In the same report of the commission, at page 33, not only
the expediency but the necessity of contractual relations be-
tween railroad companies is pointed out in the following
language:
"To make railroads of the greatest possible service to the
country, contract relations would be essential, because there
would need to be joint tariffs, joint running arrangements, an
interchange of cars and a giving of credit to a large extent,
some of which were obviously beyond the reach of compulsory
legislation, and even if they were not, could be best settled
and all the incidents and qualifications fixed by the voluntary
action of the parties in control of the roads respectively."
Also at page 35, after referring to the fact that the former
railroad associations had been continued in existence since the
enactment of the interstate commerce law, though pooling
had been prohibited, among other objects, for the "making of
regulations for uninterrupted and harmonious railroad com-
munication and exchange of traffic within the territories em-
braced by their workings," the commission observed that
isome regulations in addition to those made by the law are
almost if not altogether indispensable."
On the same page the fact is emphasized that classification
had not been taken, by the act, out of the hands of the carriers,

and it was observed that classification was best made by the
joint action of the railroads themselves. In its second annual
report the commission, in commenting upon the evils arising
from the want of friendly business relations between railroads
and the injury that a short road might cause by simply ab-
staining from extending accommodation that could not be
lawfully forced from it, said (p. 28):
" The public has an interest in being protected against the
probable exercise of any such power. But its interest goes
further than this; it goes to the establishment of such relations
among the managers of roads as will lead to the extension of
their traffic arrangements with mutual responsibility, just as
far as may be possible, so that the public may have in the ser-
vice performed all the benefits and conveniences that might
be expected to follow from general federation. There is
nothing in the existence of such arrangements which is at all
inconsistent with earnest competition. They are of general
convenience to the carriers, as well as to the public, and their
voluntary extension may be looked for until in the strife
between the roads the limits of competition are passed and
warfare is entered upon. But in order to form them great
mutual concessions are often indispensable, and such conces-
sions are likely to be made when relations are friendly, but
are not to be looked for when hostile relations have been
inaugurated."
At page 29 of the report the existence of traffic arrange-
ments between railroads is called to the attention of Congress
in the following language:
"While the commission is not at this time prepared to
recommend general legislation towards the establishment and
promotion of relations between the carriers that shall better
subserve the public interest than those that are now common,
it must nevertheless look forward to the possibility of some-
thing of that nature becoming at some time imperative, unless
a great improvement in the existing condition of things is
voluntarily inaugurated."
So, also, the existence of traffic associations, between com-
petitive roads, for purposes recognized by the act as lawful,

and their favorable tendency seems to be conceded in the
fourth annual report of the commissioners, where, at page 29,
it is said:
"If the regulations which are established by the railroad
associations were uniformly, or even generally, observed by
their members, respectively, there would be little difficulty in
enforcing a rule of reasonable rates, for the competition be-
tween the roads which even then would exist would be such
as would prevent the establishment of rates which are alto-
gether unreasonable, and the public would not be likely to
complain if they were satisfied that the rate sheets were
observed."
The character of associations such as that under consid-
eration is alluded to at page 26 of the same report, where, in
discussing the subject of how best to secure a unity of railroad
interests, it was observed " without legislation to favor it little
can be done beyond the formation of consulting and advisory
associations, and the work of these is not only necessarily
defective, but it is also limited to a circumscribed territory."
The significance of the statement that to obtain uniformity
of classification, a result most desirable for the best interests
of the public, agreements between the railroads themselves
was essential, is apparent from the fact, frequently declared
by the commission in its reports, that uniformity of classifica-
tion is one of the prerequisites of uniformity of rates. 1 Ann.

32. The very great importance of uniform and stable rates
has also frequently been reiterated in the reports of the com-
mission. Thus, at page 6 of the first annual report, in review-
ing the causes which led to the adoption of the Interstate
Commerce Act, it is said:
"Permanence of rates was also seen to be of very high im-
portance to every man engaged in business enterprises, since
without it business contracts were lottery ventures. It was
also perceived that the absolute sum of the money charges
exacted for transportation, if not clearly beyond the bounds
of reason, was of inferior importance in comparison with the
obtaining of rates that should be open, equal, relatively just
