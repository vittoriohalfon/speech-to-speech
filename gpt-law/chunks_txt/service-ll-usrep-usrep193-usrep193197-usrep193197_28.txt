it has carefully distinguished between acts which directly re-
strain commerce, and acts which only indirectly or incidentally
have that effect. United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.
S. 1, 12, 16; Joint Traffic Case, 171 U. S. 505, 566; United
States v. Ches. & Ohio Fuel Co., 105 Fed. Rep. 93; S. C., af-
firmed, 115 Fed. Rep. 610.
If the Sherman Act can be so construed as to forbid the sale
of stock in two competing railroad corporations to one pur-
chaser, then that act is an attempted interference on the part
of Congress with transactions which are wholly within the
control of the States of the Union, and in that respect the act
is unconstitutional.
As to the extent of state legislative power over the instru-
mentalities of interstate commerce, see Lozisville & Nash'ille
Case, 161 U. S. 677, 702; C. & C. Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, 154
U. S. 204. Regulation of commerce, to be constitutional,
must be confined to commerce itself, and cannot reach out to
those things which not being designed as agencies of such
commerce, or not being actually enjoined therein, may yet
have an indirect or ultimate relation thereto.
Such a construction of the Constitution would vest, in Con-
gress the regulation of all branches of productive business from
their first beginnings. License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462.
The fact that an article was manufactured for export to an-
other State does not make it an article of interstate commerce.

The creation of state corporations and the regulation of the
sales of corporation shares belong to the class of business af-
fairs over which the States have exclusive jurisdiction. Uited

193 U. S. Brief of Mr. Griggs for Northern Securities Co.
the States in the exercise of their prerogatives from permitting
two or more corporations to which the States have given life
from merging, yet such a purpose on the part of the Govern-
ment ought to be clearly and distinctly expressed, and not be
found in the judicial interpretation of doubtful language con-
tained in a penal statute.
So that, if it be argued that Congress may forbid the sale of
one railroad to another, it is enough to reply that it has never
done so; that the Sherman Act does not expressly, or by any
just interpretation, do so.
The Sherman Act is a penal statute; every act which may
be prevented by injunctive order would, if committed and
proven, subject the parties to criminal prosecution. The rule
of strict construction must be therefore applied. United States
v. Whittier, 5 Dillon, 35; United States v. Sheldon, 2 Wheat.
119; United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385; United States v.
Shacklord, 5 Mason, 445; United States v. Clayton, 2 Dillon,
219; United States v. Garretson, 42 Fed. Rep. 22; Dwarris'
Stat. 641; Hubbard v. Johnstone, 3 Taunt. 177.
Acquiescence by the Government for more than eleven years
in the actual merger and consolidation of many important
parallel and competing lines of railroads and steamships en-
gaged in interstate and international commerce, has given a
practical construction to the act of July 2, 1890, to the effect
that it was not intended to forbid, and does not forbid, the
natural processes of unification which are brought about un-
der modern methods of lease, consolidation, merger, commu-
nity of interest, or ownership of stock. As held in 1803 in
Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch, 299, where the right of a justice 'of
the Supreme Court to sit as a Circuit Judge was challenged,
upon the ground that, not having been appointed as such, and
not having been distinctly commissioned as such, the act of
Congress of 1789, under which the Circuit Court was origi-
nally instituted, was unconstitutional.
"Practice and acquiescence for a period of several years,
commencing with the organization of the judicial system,

affords an irresistible answer, and has indeed fixed the con-
struction. It is a contemporary interpretation of the most,
forcible nature. This practical exposition is too strong and
obstinate to be shaken or controlled. Of course, the question
is at rest, and ought not to be disturbed."
This is a just principle of jurisprudence, founded upon the
very highest considerations of public equity.
It has frequently been invoked and enforced in order to pre-
vent the disturbance and unsettlement of important affairs
which have been transacted in reliance upon a general public
and private belief that the law did not include them in its
terms of condemnation.
But we venture the assertion that no case has ever arisen
in which a disregard of that salutary rule of construction
would result in such widespread and irremediable injury to
vested interests as this. Not that any decree which this court
could make against these defendants would particularly or
radically affect their property interests, but because the decision
once made that the Sherman Act applies to such transactions
as the purchase, lease, merger or consolidation of plarallel lines
of transportation, would render every such transaction for
the last thirteen years unlawful, and require the Attorney
General, in the due discharge of his duty, to bring suit for dis-
solution and injunction. Unnumbered millions of dollars of
capital stock and bonds issued upon railroad mergers and con-
solidations would be tainted with illegality, or affected in
value by the withdrawal of the property against which they
were issued. Purchases of stock in underlying roads long ago
made and paid for would be unsettled, and financial chaos
would result.
Mr. M. D. Grover for appellant, Great Northern Railway
Company, submitted a brief:
The findings of fact upon which the decree rests are con-
trary to the evidence. This is made clear by separating
the findings and considering the evidence bearing on each
