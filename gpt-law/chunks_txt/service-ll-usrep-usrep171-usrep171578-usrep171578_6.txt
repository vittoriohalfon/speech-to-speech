HOPKINS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.
It is not difficult to imagine agreements of the character
above indicated. For example, cattle, when transported long
distances by rail, require rest, food and water. To give them
these accommodations it is necessary to take them from the
car and put them in pens or other places for their safe recep-
tion. Would an agieement among the landowners along the
line not to lease their lands for less than a certain sum be a
contract within the statute as being in restraint of interstate
trade or commerce? Would it be such a contract even if the
lands, or some of them, were necessary for use in furnishing
the cattle with suitable accommodations? Would an agree-
ment between the dealers in corn at some station along the
line of the road not to sell it below a certain price be covered
by the act, because the cattle must have corn for food? Or
would an agreement among the men not to perform the ser-
vice of waiering the cattle for less than a certain compensa-
-
tion come within the restriction of the statute? Suppose the
railroad company which transports the cattle itself furnishes
the facilities, and that its charges for transportation are en-
hanced because of an agreement among the landowners along
the line not to lease their lands to the company for such pur-
poses for lesz th n a named sum, could it be successfully
contended that the agreement of the landowners among them-
selves would be a violation of the act as being in restraint of
interstate trade or commerce? Would an agreement between
builders of cattle cars not to build them under a certain price
be void because the effect might be to itcrease the price of
transportation of cattle between the States? Would an agree-
ment among dealers in horse blankets not to sell them for less
than a certain price be open to the charge of a violation of
the act because horse blankets are necessary to put on horses
to be sent long journeys by rail, and by reason of the agree-
ment the expense of sending the horses from one State to an-
other for a market might be thereby enhanced? Would an
agreement among cattle drivers not to drive the cattle after
their arrival at the railroad depot at their place of destination
to the cattle yards where sold, for less than a minimum sum,
come within the statute? Would an agreement among them-

Opinion of the Court.
selves by locomotive engineers, firemen or trainmen engaged
in the service of an interstate' railroad not to work for less
than a certain named compensation be illegal because the cost
of transporting interstate freight would be thereby enhanced?
Agreements similar to these might be indefinitely suggested.
In our opinion all these queries should be answered in the
negative. The indirect effect of the agreements mentioned
might be to enhance the cost of marketing the cattle, but the
agreements themselves would not necessarily for that reason
be in restraint of interstate trade or commerce. As their
effect is either indirect or else they relate to charges for the
use of facilities furnished, the agreements instanced would be
valid provided the charges agreed upon were reasonable. The
effect upon the commerce spoken of must be direct and proxi-
mate. NArew York, Lake Brie & Western Railroad v. Penn-
8ylvania, 158 U. S. 431, 439. -
An agreement may in a variety of ways affect interstate
commerce, just as state legislation may, and yet, like it, be
entirely valid, because the interference produced by the agree-
ment or by the legislation is not direct. Sherlock v. Alling,
93 U. S. 99-103; United States v. E. C. Enight Company, 156
U. S. 1, 16; Pittsbur# & Southern Coal Co. v. Louisiana,
156 U. S. 590, .597; Transportation Company v. Parkess6urg,
107 U. S. 691; Ficklen v. Shelby County, supra. Reasonable
charges for the use of a facility for the transportation of in-
terstate commerce have heretofore been regarded as valid in
this court, even though such charges might necessarily en-
hance the cost of doing the business. - Packet Company v.
St. Louis, 100 U. S. 423; Packet Company v. Catlettsburg,

Company v. Aiken, 121 U. S. 444; St. Louis v. IMestern
Union Telegraph Company, 148 U. S. 92. An agreement
among the owners of such facilities, to charge not less than
9,m inimum rate for their .use, cannot be condemned as illegal
under the act of Congress.
The fact that the above cited cases relate to tangible prop-
erty, the use of which was charged for, does not alter the

reasoning upon which the decisions were placed. The charges
were held valid because they related to facilities furnished in
aid of the commerce and which did not constitute a regulation
thereof. Facilities may consist in privileges or conveniences
provided and made use of or in services rendered in aid of
commerce, as well as in the use of tangible property, and so
long as they are facilities and the charges not unreasonable
an agreement relating to their amount is not invalid. The
cattle owner has no constitutional right to. the services of the
commission agent to aid him in the sale of his 'cattle and
the agent has the right to say upon what terms he will
render them, and he has the equal right, so far as the act of
Congress is concerned, to agree with others in his business
not to render those services unless for a certain charge. The
services are no part of the commerce in the cattle.
In Brown v. M1aryland, 12 Wheat. 419, Chief Justice Mar-
shall, while maintaining the right of an importer to sell his
article in the original package, free from any tax, recognized
the distinction between the importer selling the article himself
and employing an auctioneer to do it for him, and he said
that in the latter case the importer could not object to paying
for such services as for any other, and that the right to sell
might very well be annexed to importation without annexing
to it also the privilege of using auctioneers, and thus to make
the sale in a peculiar way. In such case a tax upon the auc-
tioneer's license would be valid.
The same view is enforced in Emert v. .Ati&souri, 156
U. S. 296.
The right of the cattle owners themselves to sell their own
cattle is not affected or touched by the agreement in question,
while the privilege of having their cattle sold for them at
the market place frequented by defendants, and with the
aid of one of them, is a privilege which they are charged
for, and which is not annexedto their right to sell their own
cattle.
It is possible that exorbitant charges for the use of these
facilities might have similar effect as a burden on commerce
that a charge upon cbinmerce itself might have. In a case
