574 OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Curt.
This court, with care and deliberation and also with a full
appreciation of their importance, again considered the ques-
tions involved in its former decikion.
A majority of the court once more arrived at the conclu--
sion it had first announced, and accordingly it denied the
application. And now for the third time the same argu-
ments are employed, and the court is again asked to recant
its former opinion, and to decide the same question in direct
opposition to the conclusion arrived at in the Trans-Missouri
vase.
The learned counsel while making the application frankly
confess that the argument in opposition to the decision in
the case above named has been so fully, so clearly and so
forcibly presented in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice
White, that it is hardly possible to add to it nor is it necessary
to repeat it.
The fact that there was so close a -division of opinion in this
court when the matter was first under advisement, together
with the different views taken by some of the judges of the
lower courts, led us to the most careful and scrutinizing
examination of the arguments advanced by both sides, and it
was after such an examination that the majority of the court
came to the conclusion it did.
It is not now alleged that the court on the former occasion
overlooked any argument for the respondents or misapplied
any controlling authority. It is simply insisted that the court,
notwithstanding the arguments for an opposite view, arrived
at an erroneous result, which, for reasons already stated, ought
to be reconsidered and reversed.
As we have twice already deliberately and earnestly
considered the same arguments which aie now for a third
time pressed upon our attention, it could hardly be ex-
pected that ouir opinion should now change from that al-
ready expressed.
While an erroneous decision might be in some c.ses prop,
erly reconsidered and overruled, yet it is clea that the first
necessity is to convince the court that the decision was errone-
ous. It is scarcely to be assumed that such a result could be

secured by the presentation for a third time of the same argu-
ments which had twice before been unsuccessfully urged upon
-the attention of the court.
We have listened to them now because the eminence of the
.counsel engaged, their earnestness and zeal, their evident belief
in the correctness of their position, and, most important of all,
the very grave nature of the questions argued, called upon the
,court to again give to those arguments strict and respectful
attention. It is not matter for surprise that we still are
unable to see the error alleged to exist in our former deci-
sion, or to change our opinion regarding the questions therein
involved.
Upon the point that the agreement is not in fact one in
restraint of trade, even though it did prevent competition, it
must be admitted that the former argument has now been
much enlarged and amplified, and a general and most mas-
terly review of that question has been presented by-counsel
for the respondents. That this agreement does in fact pre-
vent competition, and that it must have been so intended, we
have already attempted to sh6w. Whether stifling competi-
tion tends directly to restrain commerce in the case of natu-
rally competing railroads, is a question upon which counsel
have argued with very great ability. They acknowledge that
this agreement purports to restrain competition, although, they
say, in a very slight degree and on a single point. They admit
that if competition and commerce were identical, being but
different names for the same thing, then, in assuming to re-
strain competition even so far, it would be assuming in a
corresponding degree to restrain commerce. Counsel then
add (and therein we entirely agree with them) that no such
identity can be pretended, because it .is plain that commerce
can and does take place on a large scale and in numerous
forms without competition. The material considerations
therefore turn upon the effects of competition upon the
business of railroads, whether they are favorable to the com-
merce in which the roads are engaged, or unfavorable and in
restraint of that commerce. Upon that question it is con-
tended that agreements between railroad companies of the

nature of that now before us are promotive instead of in
restraint of trade.
This conclusion is reached by counsel after an examination
of the peculiar nature of railroad property and the alleged
baneful effects of competition upon it and also upon the pub-
lic. It is stated that the only resort open to railroads to save
themselves from the effects of a ruinous competition is that of
agreements among themselves to check and control it. A
ruinous competition is, as they say, apt to be carried on until
the weakest of the combatants goes to destruction. After
that the survivor, being relieved from, competition, proceeds
to raise its prices as high as the business will bear. Com-
merce, it is said, thus finally becomes restrained by the effects
of competition, while, at the same time, otherwise valuable
railroad 'property is thereby destroyed or greatly reduced in
value. There can be no doubt that the general tendency of
competition among competing railroads is towards lower rates
for transportation, and the result of lower rates is generally
a greater demand for the articles, so transported, and this
greater demand can only be gratified by a larger supply, the
furnishing of which increases commerce. This is the first and
direct result of competition among railroad carriers.
In the absence of any agreement restraining competition,
this result, it is argued, is neutralized, and the opposite one
finally reached by reason of the peculiar nature of railroad
property which must be oper4ted and the capital invested in
which cannot be withdrawn, and the railroad managers are
therefore, as is claimed, compelled to not only compete among
themselves for business, but also to carry on the war of com-
petition until it shall terminate in the utter destruction or the
buying up of the weaker roads, after which the survivor will
raise the rates as high as is possible. Thus the indirect but
final effect of competition is claimed to be the raising of
rates and the consequent restraint of trade, and it is urged
that this result is only to be prevented by such an agreement
as we have here. In that way alone it is said that competi-
tion is overcome, and general uniformity and reasonableness
of rates securely established.
