NORTHERN SECURITIES CO. v. UNITED STATES. 275
193 U. S. Argument of Mr. Bunn for Northern Pacific Railway.
If a thing restrains interstate commerce it is immaterial how
innocent the intent may be, and if it does not restrain it, it is
immaterial how evil the intent may be. The question is does
the agreement restrain trade or commerce. United States v.
Freight Association, 166 U. S. 290, 341; Addyston Case, supra.
If an action be lawful its purpose is immaterial. This is ele-
mentary. Phelps v. Nowlen, 72 N. Y. 39, 45; Kiff v. You-
moans, 86 N. Y. 324, 329; Wood v. Amory, 105 N. Y. 278, 281;
Lough v. Outerbridge, 143 N. Y. 271, 282; Adler v. Fenton, 24
How. 407, 410; United States v. Greenhut, 51 Fed. Rep. 205,
211; In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104, 111; Randall v. Hazle-
ton, 12 Allen, 412, 418; Brackett v. Griswold, 112 N. Y. 454;
United States v. Isham, 17 Wall. 496; Dickerman v. Northern
Trust Co., 176 U. S. 181; Fahrney v. Kelly, 102 Fed. Rep.
403; Mogul S. S. Co. v. McGregor, App. Cas. (1892) 25, 41;
Allen v. Flood, L. R. App. Cas. (1898) 1; Bohn Mjg. Co. v.
Hollis, 54 Minnesota, 223, 234. The opinion of the court be-
low proceeds upon the proposition that a combination of two
competitors is a restraint of trade-because it lessens competi-
tion. This is error. The Trans-Missouri, Joint Traffic and
Addyston cases prove only that a contract restraining rival
companies from competing is a restraint of trade. No such
agreement exists in this case. The law does not require com-
petition. The business of a rival may be purchased for the
purpose of being rid of his competition. Gamble v. Queens
County Water Co., 123 N. Y. 91, 104; Diamond Match
Co. v. Roeber, 106 N. Y. 473; Rafferty v. Buffalo City Gas
Co., 37 N. Y. App. Div. 618, 621; Trenton Potteries Co. v.

The Securities Company is neither alleged nor proved to have
(lone or omitted anything which can be construed as a viola-
tion of the Anti-Trust Act. If it has the power to suppress or
diminish competition it has not used it and if the act has been
violated at all it must be due to the mere existence of the Se-
curities Company, to its powers as applicable to railway com-

Brief of Mr. Griggs for Northern Securities Co. 19:3 IT. S.
panics or to something illegal in its origin. The illegality can
not be sustained under the decisions of this court.
Mr. John TV. Griggs for appellant, Northern Securities
Company, submitted a brief:
The acts of the defendants do not constitute a contract, com-
bination, or conspiracy in restraint of interstate trade or coin-
merce within the meaning and prohibition of the Sherman
Act. The United States rests its case upon two allegations:
First. That the Northern Securities Company has been
formed and has taken over a majority of the shares of the two
railroad companies in the manner indicated by the pleadings
and proofs.
Second. That the intended and the necessary effect, of those
acts is to destroy competition between the two railroad coin-
panies.
The answer of the defendants is:
First. That the formation of the Northern Securities Com-
pany and the acquirement by it of stock of the two railroad
companies was a lawful transaction, governed solely by local
state laws, and not in contravention of any provision of the
Federal Constitution or statutes.
Second. That the acts of the defendants were all done in
good faith, without any purpose to destroy competition or re-
strain trade.
To put it more concisely: The defendants contendI that
what they have done is lawful, has no direct effect in restraint
of competition, and was not intended to restrain competition.
The creation of railway corporations; the form of their cor-
porate organization; the character and qualities of their cor-
porate stock; the routes which their roads shall take, whether
they may connect with other roads running in the same gen-
eral direction, whether they may or may not consolidate with
parallel lines, or operate parallel lines through different por-
tions of a State-all these matters are, and always have been,
subjects of state jurisdiction. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v.

193 U. S. Brief of Mr. Griggs for Northern Securities Co.
Kentucky, 161 U. S. 677, 702; Pearsall v. Great Northern, 161
U. S. 646; Lake Shore & Mich. Southern v. Ohio, 173 U. S.
285; Missouri, Kansas & Texas v. Haber, 169 U. S. 613; Cleve-
land &c. Railway v. Illinois, 177 U. S. 514.
The lower court did not find as matter of fact that the de-
fendants had in any way restrained trade or commerce; or
that they had attempted so to do; or that they had contracted
or combined so to do. What the court did find and decide
was, that the defendants had done certain things whereby they
had obtained the power to suppress competition between two
interstate carriers who own and operate competing and par-
allel lines of railroad. This idea is repeated again and again
throughout the opinion. It speaks of "a direct restraint of in-
terstate commerce because it would have placed in the hands
of a small coterie of men the power to suppress competition
between two competing interstate carriers."
To say that one person, or several persons, cannot acquire
or own a majority of the stock of two competing railroad cor-
porations because they are thereby occupying a vantage
ground from which they can, if they choose, effect an agree-
ment or understanding between the two companies in restraint
of competition, is to say that the power to commit a crime is
equivalent to its actual commission.
The acts of the defendants being prima facie lawful, the
burden of proof is upon the Government to show that they
were, as the Attorney General charges, not bona fide, but a
mere formal device intended to defeat the provisions of the
Sherman Act. Joint Traffic, Trans-Missouri, Addyston Pipe
Cases; United States v. Hopkins, 171 U. S. 578; United States
v. Workingmen's Amalgamated Council, 54 Fed. Rep. 994;
State v. Shippers Compress & Warehouse Co., 67 S. W. Rep.
(Texas) 1049; S. C., affirmed, 69 S. W. Rep. 58.
Afiy restraint of trade or commerce which may result from
the acts done by the defendants is indirect and incidental only,
and not covered by the act. In every instance where this
court has had occasion to pass upon the meaning of the act
