The sellers' act in delivering the merchandise to the common
carrier, or carrying the merchandise to the carrier's depot (if
that is taken to be in effect alleged), is not any part of the
interstate transportation, and does not make the goods the
subject of interstate commerce. Coe v Errol, 116 U S. 517,
528.
The fact that the sale is made with a view to the goods
being transported by the buyer's agent to another State after
the sale and delivery is fully completed, does not make the
sale interstate commerce.
The sales alleged in the third paragraph of the bill, by agents
of the owners in other States and Territories to whom the
owners of the fresh meats have shipped the same for sale there
by such agents on the ground, are not incidents of interstate
commerce. Coe v Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 525, Kidd v Pear-
son, 128 U S. 1, 23, United States v E. C Knsght Co., 156

Lurman, 192 U S. 189, 198, Am. Harrow Co. v Shaffer, 68
Fed. Rep. 750; Stevens v Oho, 93 Fed. Rep. 793.
Under the allegations here in question, it is to be taken
that the meats, before the sales here referred to are made,
have come to their place of rest and are at rest for an indefinite
time awaiting sale at their place of destination, and are a
commodity in the market where the sales are made, and that
the sales are not in the "original packages", and that the
meats, at the time of the sales, have become a part of the
general property in the State where sold, and are there handled
and sold as such. Southern Coal Co. v Bates, 156 I S. 577,
588, Brown v Houston, 114 U S. 623, 632, Emert v Missour,
156 U S. 296, 310; Singer Mfg. Co. v Wright, 97 Georgia, 123.
The point here made is entirely consistent with the rulings

196 U. S. Argument for Appellants.
in many cases, that the owner of merchandise, who transports
it from one State to another for sale, has a right (which cannot
be interfered with by state or municipal laws) to sell it as an
article of interstate commerce. He also has a right to make
such article part of the general property of the State into which
it is taken, and he then has the right to sell and others have the
right to purchase it as an article of domestic commerce, which
cannot be interfered with by Federal law The Sherman Act
does not seek to and could not interfere with that right.
United States v E. C Knight Co., 156 U S. 1, 15, and Kidd v.
Pearson and Veazie v Moor, there cited. But this bill here
does seek to interfere with that right. Again, the point here
made is not touched by the line of decisions holding that state
or municipal laws are invalid, which, by taxation or other
regulations, discriminate against merchandise brought from
another State, or seek to prevent interstate commerce therein,
-such as Welton v Missoum, 91 U S. 465, Walling v Michs-
gan, 116 U. S. 446, Minnesota v Barber, 136 U. S. 313, Brimmer
v Rebman, 138 U. S. 78, and Schollenberger v Pennsylvana,
171 U S. 1, 24, 25.
The bill of complaint does not show any contract, combina-
tion or conspiracy m restraint of interstate trade or commerce
within the meaning of the Sherman Act.
It does not allege any acts of defendants monopolizing or
attempting to monopolize or combining or conspiring to
monopolize such trade or commerce.
If the act in question be given a construction which would
sustain this bill of complaint, the statute would be uncon-
stitutionai.
The alleged offenses complained of are set forth in the sixth,
seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh paragraphs of the
bill. As to the sixth and seventh paragraphs we maintain.
The allegations of combination and conspiracy here are of
mere legal conclusions. That the purchases of live stock re-
ferred to in the sixth and seventh paragraphs, as therein
alleged, are not interstate commerce.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Argument for Appellants. 19G U. S.
The first pijragraph of the bill in which the business of pur-
chasing live stock for slaughter is set forth and described, does
not allege oi/show that the business is interstate commerce.
The description of the live stock in the sixth paragraph, as
live stock produced and owned principally in other States and
Territories, and shipped by the owners to the places where
sold, for sale to persons engaged in producing and dealing in
fresh meat, does not show that the sales of the live stock are
interstate commerce. The live stock, when offered for sale
in the pens of the stock yards, are, under the allegations of fact
in the bill, to be considered as having become part of the gen-
eral mass of property of the State where offered for sale. The
defendants purchasing the live stock have the right so to treat
and deal therewith. Brown v Houston, 114 U. S. 622, 632;
Pittsburgh Coal Co. v Bates, 156 U S. 577, 588, 589; Emert v.
Missoun, 120 U S. 489, 497 When purchased, the live stock
is, under the allegations of this bill, at rest for an indefinite
time, awaiting sale at its place of destination. Dmmond Match
Co. v Ontonagon, 188 U S. 82, 92.
The defendants have as much right, then, to treat and deal
with and purchase such live stock as an article of domestic
commerce as the State has so to treat it for the purposes of
taxation or regulation. This bill seeks to interfere with that
right under the Sherman Act.
If the sworn allegations of the bill in this respect were to be
supplemented by other facts, as matters of common knowledge,
with respect to the situation of the live stock when sold, such
as appeared in the Hopkins and Anderson cases, the case of the
Government would be no better. It would then appear that
the cattle and other live stock are shipped to commission
merchants at the stock yards; are then placed in the pens of
the stock yards companies, and there held, cared for and fed
by the stock yards company for the account of the commission
merchants, and under the allegations here it must be taken
that their bulk is broken up, they are divided into lots and sold
and delivered by the commission merchant as the principal or
