bracing such unlawful restraints upon the purchasing of goods
in one State to be carried to another State as necessarily arise
from the existence of combinations formed for the purpose and
with the effect, not only of monopolizing the ownership of all
such goods in every part of the country, but of controlling the
prices for them in all the States. This view of the scope of
the act leaves the public, so far as national power is con-
cerned, entirely at the mercy of combinations which arbitra-
rily control the prices of articles purchased to be transported
from one State to another State. I cannot assent to that
view In my judgment, the general government is not placed
by the Constitution in such a condition of helplessness that it
must fold its arms and remain inactive while capital combines,
under the name of a corporation, to destroy competition, not
m one State only, but throughout the entire country, in the
buying and selling of articles -especially the necessaries of
life- that go into commerce among the States. The doc-
trine of the autonomy of the States cannot properly be in-
voked to justify a denial of power in the national government
to meet such an emergency, involving as it does that freedom
of commercial intercourse among the States which the Consti-
tution sought to attain.
It is said that there are no proofs in the record which indi-
cate an mitentzon upon the part of the American Sugar Refin-
ing Company and its associates to put a restraint upon trade
or commerce. Was it necessary that formal proof be made
that the persons engaged m this combination admitted, in
words, that they intended to restrain trade or commerce2
Did any one expect to find in the written agreements which
resulted m the formation of this combination a distinct expres-
sion of a purpose to restrain interstate trade or commerce 2
Men who form and control these combinations are too cau-
tious and wary to make such admissions orally or in writing.
Why, it is conceded that the object of this combination was
to obtain control of the business of making and selling refined
sugar throughout the entire country Those interested in its
operations will be satisfied with nothing less than to have the
whole population of America pay tribute to.t hem. That object

is disclosed upon the very face of the transactions described in
the bill. And it is proved - indeed, is conceded - that that
object has been accomplished to the extent that the American
Sugar Refining Company now controls ninety-eight per cent
of all the sugar refining business in the country, and therefore
controls the price of that article everywhere. Now, the mere
emstence of a combination having such an object and possess-
ing such extraordinary power is itself, under settled principles
of law -there being no adjudged case to the contrary in this
country- a direct restraint of trade in the article for the con-
trol of the sales of which in this country that combination
was organized. And that restraint is felt in all the States,
for the reason, known to all, that the article in question goes,
was intended to go, and must always go, into commerce among
the several States, and into the homes of people in every con-
dition of life.
A decree recognizing the freedom of commercial intercourse
as embracing the right to buy goods to be transported from
one State to another, without buyers being burdened by un-
lawful restraints imposed by combinations of corporations or
individuals, so far from disturbing or endangering, would tend
to preserve the autonomy of the States, and protect the people
of all the States against dangers so portentous as to excite
apprehension for the safety of our liberties. If this be not
a sound interpretation of the Constitution, it is easy to per-
ceive that interstate traffic, so far as it involves the price to
be paid for articles necessary to the comfort and well-being
of the people in all the States, may pass under the absolute
control of overshadowing combinations having financial re-
sources without limit and an audacity in the accomplishment
of their objects that recognizes none of the restraints of moral
obligations controlling the action of individuals, combinations
governed entirely by the law of greed and selfishness -so
powerful that no single State is able to overthrow them and
give the required protection to the whole country, and so all-
pervading that they threaten the integrity of our institutions.
We have before us the case of a combination which abso-
lutely controls, or may, at its discretion, control the price of all

Congress may impose or permit for the benefit of the whole

and injuriously affects the entire commerce of the country,
which concerns equally all the people of the Union, and which,.
it must be confessed, cannot be adequately controlled by any
one State. Its authority should not be so weakened by con-
struction that it cannot reach and eradicate evils that, beyond
