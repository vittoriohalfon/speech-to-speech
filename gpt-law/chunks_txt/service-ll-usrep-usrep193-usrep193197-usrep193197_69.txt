exercise a kind of hydraulic pressure which makes' what pre-
viously was clear seem doubtful, and before which even well
settled principles of law will bend. What we have to do in
this case is to find the meaning of some not very difficult
words. We must try, I have tried, to do it with the same
freedom of natural and spontaneous interpretation that one
would be sure of if the same question arose upon an indict-
ment for a similar act which excited no public attention, and
was of importance only to a prisoner before the court. Fur-
thermore, while at times judges need for their work the train-
ing of economists or statesmen, and must act in view of their
foresight of consequences, yet when their task is to interpret
and apply the words of a statute, their function is merely aca-
demic to begin with-to read English intelligently-and a con-
sideration of consequences comes into play, if at all, only when
the meaning of the words used is open to reasonable doubt.
The question to be decided is whether, under the act of
July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209, it is unlawful, at any stage
of the process, if several men unite to form a corporation for
the purpose of buying more than half the stock of each of two
competing interstate railroad companies, if they form the cor-
poration, and the corporation buys the stock. I will suppose
further that every step is taken, from the beginning, with the
single intent of ending competition between the companies.
I make this addition not because it may not be and is not dis-
puted but because, as I shall try to show, it is totally unimpor-
tant under any part of the statute with which we have to
deal.
The statute of which we have to find the meaning is a crim-
inal statute. The two sections on which the Government re-
lies both make certain acts crimes. That is their immediate
purpose and that is what they say. It is vain to insist that
this is not a criminal proceeding. The words cannot bie read
one way in a suit which is to end in fine and imprisonment
and another way in one which seeks an injunction. The con-
struction which is adopted in this case must'be adopted in one

of the other sort. I am no friend of artificial interpretations
because a statute is of one kind rather than another, but all
agree that before a statute is to be taken to punish that which
always has been lawful it must express its intent in clear
words. So I say we must read the words before us as if the
question were whether two small exporting grocers should go
to jail.
Again the statute is of a very sweeping and general charac-
ter. It hits "every" contract or combination of the pro-
hibited sort, great or small, and "every" person who shall
monopolize or attempt to monopolize, in the sense of the act,
"any part" of the trade or commerce among the several States.
There is a natural inclination to assume that it was directed
against certain great combinations and to read it in that
light. It does not say so. On the contrary, it says "every,"
and "any part." Still less was it directed specially against
railroads. There even was a reasonable doubt whether it in-
eluded railroads until the point was decided by this court.
Finally, the statute must be construed in such a way as not
merely to save its constitutionality but, so far as is consistent
with a fair interpretation, not to raise grave doubts on that
score. I assume, for the purposes of discussion, although it
would be a great and serious step to take, that in some case
that seemed to it to need heroic measures, Congress might
regulate not only commerce, but instruments of commerce or
contracts the bearing of which upon commerce would be only
indirect. But it is clear that the mere fact of an indirect effect
upon commerce not shown to be certain and very great,
would not justify such a law. The point decided in United
States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1, 17, was that "the fact
that trade or commerce might be indirectly affected was
not enough to entitle complainants to a decree." Commerce
depends upon population, but Congress could not, on that
ground, undertake to regulate marriage and divorce. If the
act before us is to be carried out according to what seems to
me the logic of the argument for the Government, which I do

not believe that it will be, I can see no part of the conduct of
life with which on similar principles Congress might not inter-
fere.
This act is construed by the Government to affect the pur-
chasers of shares in two railroad companies because of the
effect it may have, or, if you like, is certain to have, upon the
competition of these roads. If such a remote result of the
exercise of an ordinary incident of property and personal free-
dom is enough to make that exercise unlawful, there is hardly
any transaction concerning commerce between the States
that may not be made a crime by the finding of a jury or
a court. The personal ascendency of one man may be such
that it would give to his advice the effect of a command, if he
owned but a single share in each road. The tendency of his
presence in the stockholders' meetings might be certain to
prevent competition, and thus his advice, if not his mere exist-
ence, become a crime.
I state these general considerations as matters which I should
have to take into account before I could agree to affirm the de-
cree appealed from, but I do not need them for my own opin-
ion, because when I read the act I cannot feel sufficient doubt
as to the meaning of the words to need to fortify my conclu-
sion by any generalities. Their meaning seems to me plain on
their face.
The first section makes "Every contract, combination in the
form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade
or commerce among the several States, or with foreign na-
tions" a misdemeanor, punishable by fine, imprisonment or
both. Much trouble is made by substituting other phrases as-
sumed to be equivalent, which then are reasoned from as if
they were in the act. The court below argued as if maintain-
ing competition were the expressed object of the act. The
act says nothing about competition. I stick to the exact
words used. The words hit two classes of cases, and only
two-Contracts in restraint of trade and combinations or con-
spiracies in restraint of trade, and we have to consider what
