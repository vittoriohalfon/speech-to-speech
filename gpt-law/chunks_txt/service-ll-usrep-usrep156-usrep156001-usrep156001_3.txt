UINITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.
Opinion of the Court.
Mfu. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the case, delivered
the opimon of the court.
By the purchase of the stock of the four Philadelphia
Tefineries, with shares of its own stock, the American Sugar
Refining Company acquired nearly complete control of the
manufacture of refined sugar within the United States. The bill
-charged that the contracts under which these purchases were
-made constituted combinations in restraint of trade, and that
in entering into them the defendants combined and conspired
to restrain the trade and commerce in refined sugar among
the several States and with foreign nations, contrary to the
;act of Congress of July 2, 1890.
The relief sought was the cancellation of the agreements
under which the stock was transferred, the redelivery of the
-tock to the parties respectively, and an injunction against the
further performance of the agreements and further violations
of the act. As usual, there was a prayer for general relief, but
-only such relief could be afforded under that prayer as would
be agreeable to the case made by the bill and consistent with
that specifically prayed. And as to the injunction asked, that
relief was ancillary to and in aid of the primary equity, or
ground of suit, and, if that failed, would fall with it. That
ground here was the existence of contracts to monopolize
interstate or international trade or commerce, and to restrain
such trade or commerce, which, by the provisions of the act,
could be rescinded, or operations thereunder arrested.
In commenting upon the statute, 21 Jac. 1, c. 3, at the com-
mencement of chapter 85 of the third Institute, entitled
"Against Monopolists, Propounders, and Projectors," Lord
Coke, in language often quoted, said
"It appeareth by the preamble of this act (as a judgment
in Parliament) that all grants of monopolies are against the
ancient and fundamentall laws of this Kingdome. And there-
fore it is necessary to define what a monopoly is.
"A monopoly is an institution, or allowance by the King
by his grant, commission, or otherwise to any person or
persons, bodies politique, or corporate, of or for the sole
