of interstate trade or commerce because it provides for a
minimum amount of commissions for the sale of the cattle.
Objections are taken to other parts of the by-laws which
we will notice hereafter.
Notwithstanding these various matters undertaken by
defendants, we must keep our attention upon the real busi-
ness transacted by them, and in regard to which the section
of the by-law complained of is made. The section amounts
to an agreement, and it relates to charges made for services
performed in selling cattle upon commission at Kansas City.
The charges relate to that business alone. In order to obtain
it the defendants advance money to the cattle owner; they
pay his drafts, and they aid him to keep his cattle and make
them fit for the market. All this is done as a means towards
an end; as an inducement to the cattle owner to give one of
the defendants the business of selling the cattle fQr him when
the owner shall' finally determine to sell them. That busi-
ness is not al tered in character because ,of the various things
done by defendants for the cattle owner in order to secure it.
The competition among the defendants and others who may
be engaged in it, to obtain the business, results in their send-
ing outside the city, to cattle owners, to urge them by dis-
tinct and various inducements to send their cattle to one of
the defendants to sell for them. In this view it is immaterial
over how many States the defendants may themselves or by
their agents travel in order to thereby secure the business.
They do not purchase the cattle themselves ; they do'not trans-
port them. They receive them at Kansas City, and the com-
plaint made is in regard to the agreements for charges for the
services at that point in selling the cattle for the owner. Thus
everything at last centres at the mafket at Kansas City, and
the charges are for'services there, and there only, performed.
The selling of an article at its destination, which has been
sent from another State, while it may be regarded as an
interstate sale and one which the importer was entitled to
make,.yet the services of the individual employed at the place
where the article is sold are not so connected with the subject
sold as to make them a portion of interstate commerce, and a

combination in regard to the amount to be charged for such
service is not, therefore, a combination in restraint of that
trade or commerce. Granting that the cattle themselves,
because coming from another State, are articles of interstate
commerce, yet it does not therefore follow that before their
sate all persons performing services in any way connected
with them are themselves engaged in that commerce, or that
their agreements among each other relative to the compensa-
tion to be charged for their services are void as agreements
made in restraint of interstate trade. The commission agent
in selling the cattle for their owner simply aids him in finding
a market; but the facilities thus afforded the owner by the
agent are not of such a nature as to thereby make that agent
an individual engaged in interstate commerce, nor is his
agreement with others engaged in the same business, as to the
terms upon which they would provide these facilities, rendered
void as a contract .in restraint of that commerce. Even all
agreements among buyers of cattle from other States are not
necessarily a violation of the act, although such agreements
may undoubtedly affect that commerce.
The charges of the agent on account of his services are
nothing more than charges for aids or facilities furnished the
owner whereby his object may be the more easily and readily
accomplished. Charges for the transportation of cattle be-
tween different Stites are charges for doing something which
is one of the forms of and which itself constitutes interstate
trade or commerce, while charges or commissions based upon
services performed .for the owner in effecting the sale of the
cattle are not directly connected with, as forming part of, in-
terstate commerce, although the cattle may have come from
another State. Charges for services of this nature do not
immediately touch or act upon nor do they directly affect the
subject of the transportation. Indirectly and as an incident,
they may enhance the cost to the owner of the cattle in find-
ing a market, or they may add to the price paid by a pur-
chaser, but they are not charges which are directly laid upon
the article in the course of transportation, and which are
charges upon the commerce itself; they are charges for the

facilities given or provided the owner in the course of the
movement from the home situs of the article to the place and
point where it is sold.
The contract. condemned ,by the statute is one whose direct
and immediate effect is a restraint upon that kind of trade or
commerce which is interstate. Charges for such facilities as
we have already mentioned are not a restraint upon that
trade, although the total cost of marketing a subject thereof
may be thereby increased. Charges for facilities furnished
have been held not a regulation of commerce; even when made
for services rendered or as compensation for benefits con-
ferred. Sands v. Manistee River Improvement Co., 123 U" S.
288; Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, 148 U. S.
312, 329, 330; Kentucky & IndianaB ridge Company v. Louis-
yille &c. Railroad,3 7 Fed. Rep. 567.
To -treat as condemned by the act all agreements under
which, as a result, the cost of conducting an interstate com-
mercial business may be increased would enlarge the applica-
tion of the act far beyond the fair meaning of the language
used. There must be some direct and immediate effect upon
interstate commerce in order to come within the act. The
State may levy a tax upon the earnings of a commission mer-
chant Which were realized out of the sales of property belong-
ing to non-residents, and such a tax is not one upon interstate
commerce because it affects it only incidentally and remotely
although certainly. _Ficklem v. Shelby County Taxing Dis-
trict, 145 U. S.1 . 'any agreements suggest themselves which
relate only to facilities furnished commerce, or else touch it
only in an indirect way, while possibly enhancing the cost of
transacting the business, and which at the same time we
would not think of as agreements in restraint of interstate
trade or commerce. They are agreements which in their effect
operate in furtherance and in aid of commerce by providing
for it facilities, conveniences, privileges or services, but which
do not directly relate to charges for its transportation, nor to
any other form of interstate commerce. To hold all such agree-
ments void would in our judgment improperly extend the act
to matters which are not of an interstate commercial nature.
