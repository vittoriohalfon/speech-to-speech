Opinion of the Court
companies, alleging horizontal price fixing in their fees for
title searches and title examinations. One company settled
by consent decree, while five other firms continue to contest
the matter. The Commission charged the title companies
with violating ยง 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act,
38 Stat. 719, 15 U. S. C. ยง45(a)(1), which prohibits "[u]nfair
methods of competition in or affecting commerce." One of
the principal defenses the companies assert is state-action
immunity from antitrust prosecution, as contemplated in the
line of cases beginning with Parkerv . Brown, 317 U. S. 341
(1943). The Commission rejected this defense, In re Ticor
Title Ins. Co., 112 F. T. C. 344 (1989), and the firms sought
review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit. Ruling that state-action immunity was available
under the state regulatory schemes in question, the Court
of Appeals reversed. 922 F. 2d 1122 (1991). We granted
certiorari. 502 U. S. 806 (1991).

Title insurance is the business of insuring the record title
of real property for persons with some interest in the estate,
including owners, occupiers, and lenders. A title insurance
policy insures against certain losses or damages sustained by
reason of a defect in title not shown on the policy or title
report to which it refers. Before issuing a title insurance

FTC v. TICOR TITLE INS. CO.
Opinion of the Court
policy, the insurance company or one of its agents performs
a title search and examination. The search produces a
chronological list of the public documents in the chain of title
to the real property. The examination is a critical analysis
or interpretation of the condition of title revealed by the doc-
uments disclosed through this search.
The title search and examination are major components of
the insurance company's services. There are certain vari-
ances from State to State and from policy to policy, but a
brief summary of the functions performed by the title compa-
nies can be given. The insurance companies exclude from
coverage defects uncovered during the search; that is, the
insurers conduct searches in order to inform the insured and
to reduce their own liability by identifying and excluding
known risks. The insured is protected from some losses re-
sulting from title defects not discoverable from a search of
the public records, such as forgery, missing heirs, previous
marriages, impersonation, or confusion in names. They are
protected also against errors or mistakes in the search and
examination. Negligence need not be proved in order to re-
cover. Title insurance also includes the obligation to defend
in the event that an insured is sued by reason of some defect
within the scope of the policy's guarantee.
The title insurance industry earned $1.35 billion in gross
revenues in 1982, and respondents accounted for 57 percent
of that amount. Four of respondents are the nation's largest
title insurance companies: Ticor Title Insurance Co., with
16.5 percent of the market; Chicago Title Insurance Co., with
12.8 percent; Lawyers Title Insurance Co., with 12 percent;
and SAFECO Title Insurance Co. (now operating under the
name Security Union Title Insurance Co.), with 10.3 percent.
Stewart Title Guarantee Co., with 5.4 percent of the market,
is the country's eighth largest title insurer, with a strong
position in the West and Southwest. App. to Pet. for Cert.
