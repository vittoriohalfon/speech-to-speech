purpose of maintaining any standard of wages;" and the act
of May 25, 1899, because it was cumulative and a mere supple-
ment to the others, and carried, therefore, the same uncon-
stitutional discriminations.
All of the acts and code provisions are charged with depriv-
ing the oil company of its property without due process of law
and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that the
penalties are excessive and their provisions so vague and
uncertain that the company is denied a resort to the tribunals
of the country to defend its rights except on the condition
that, if not successful, it shall subject its property to con-
fiscation and forfeit its right to do business in the State.
It is also urged as a ground of demurrer that the act of 1895
violated a provision of the constitution of the State which
prohibited a bill to contain more than one subject.
The demurrer was overruled. The company declined to
answer further, and judgment was entered forfeiting the license
or permit of the company, and enjoining the company from
transacting any business in the State "except such business
as may be and constitute interstate commerce." The judg-
ment was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals. A rehearing
was denied and a writ of error from the Supreme Court of the
State refused. This writ of error was then granted.
Mr. William V. Rowe and Mr. R. S. Lovett, with whom
Mr. Ralph Oakley and Mr. James A. Baker were on the brief,
for plaintiff in error in this case and in No. 38 argued simul-
taneously herewith.1
The acts of 1889 and 1895 are in contravention of section 1,
Article XIV, of the Amendments of the Constitution of the
United States, and therefore .void, because of the provisions
permitting agriculturists, live stock raisers and laborers to
form combinations denounced by the acts when formed by
others. Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S.5 40.

197 U. S. Argument for Plaintiff in Error.
Revised Statutes and Penal Code, the legislature exempted
certain classes from punishment for the same offense charged
in this case, and, such discriminating provisions being un-
repealed and unaffected by the Anti-Trust Act of 1899, the
whole system of statutes is, as a consequence, unconstitutional.
The decisions of the Texas Supreme Court and the legi$-
lative enactments show that the legislature intended that the
exemption of agriculturists, stock raisers and laborers should
remain unimpaired by the Anti-Trust Act of 1897. Texas

Co., 67 S. W. Rep. 1049; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. State, 19
T. C. A. 1; Houck v. Anheuser &c., 88 Texas, 184.
Taking all the statutes together the act of 1899 is a mere
addition to the previous acts and a part of them. The acts
being clearly in pari materia, they must of course be read
together and treated as parts of one system. Potter's Dwarris,
189; Alexander v. Mayor, 5 Cranch, 1; Patterson v. Winn, 11
Wheat. 380; Ryan v. Carter, 93 U. S. 78, 84; Pearce v. Atwood,
13 Massachusetts, 324, 344; Regina v. Tonbridge Overseers,
L. R. 13 Q. B. Div. 339; Sutherland Stat. Con. ยง2 88.
The rule has been recognized in Texas. Cain v. State, 20

Sundberg, 5 Texas, 418; Selman v. Wolfe, 27 Texas, 68; Han-
rick v. Hanrick, 54 Texas, 101.
Where the question is merely one of the construction of a
state statute, which does not necessarily involve a Federal
question the determination of the state. court' is conclusive
upon this court. Osborne v. Florida, 164 U. S. 650, 656. But
this court is not bound by state court decisions construing,
state statutes, where a Federal question is involved. See as
to Federal citizenship: Boyd v. Nebraska, 143 U. S. 135. As
to rights of Federal corplorations: Roberts v. Northern Pacific

147 U. S. 248, 258. Jefferson Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black, 436,
distinguished.
This case comes within the principle of these exceptions.
This court cannot accept as conclusive the decision of the
state court as to the scope, meaning and effect of this ad-
mitted exemption clause, effecting, when construed with the
other statutes of the State, in pari materia, what is claimed
to be an arbitrary classification of persons, in respect to the
offense in question, in violation of the rights guaranteed by
the Fourteenth Amendment. That, like the qjuestions of due
process of law, full faith and credit to which state judgments
are entitled, and of the impairment of contract obligations is,
essentially and necessarily, a question for the final and inde-
pendent determination of this court.
Plaintiff in error is really asking this court not to contro-
vert, but rather to lean towards, and follow, the state court
on this subject.
Since the Anti-Trust Statutes are in contravention of the
Federal Constitution they are absolutely void; and are in-
effectual for any purpose against corporations as well as indi-
viduals. Cooley's Const. Lim., 5th ed., 224; Reagan v. Trust
Co., 154 U. S. 362; West. Un. Tel. Co. v. State, 62 Texas, 630.
