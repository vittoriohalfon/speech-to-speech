or added to their own legal obligations. Very likely a re-
ceiver, if he had been appointed, would on his own motion
have taken out insurance upon the property, or would have
been directed by the court to do so, in order to cover the in-
terest of the bondholders. But no receiver was appointed and
no such insurance was taken out, and we cannot see that the
defendant, The Penn Company, has in any manner made itself
liable to pay to the complainant any of the insurance moneys
which it obtained to cover its own interest only, in the property,
because of the successful opposition made by it to the appoint-
ment of a receiver.
The court on hearing all sides and interests denied the appli-
cation. Thbre was nothing which then prevented the complain-
ant from itself taking out insurance under the tenth article of
the mortgage. It could have taken out such insurance as a
thing proper to be done by it as trustee within the provisions
of the mortgage, and in such case it would have been entitled,
by the specific provisions in the tenth article, to reimbursement
therefor and to compensation from the trust fund. We do not
say that it was its duty to do so, for it had no cash of the mort-
gagor on hand, but it had the power under the article to ad-
vance the insurance premiums and the right to demand reim-
bursement and compe~lsation for having done so. The fact that
it had no funds at its command at that time is very likbly an
answer to the proposition that it was its duty to have itself pro-
cured insurance; but if it had advanced the money and thus
procured the insurance, the amount which it advanced would
have been a lien on the trust fund and payable thereout before
any claim on the part of the bondholders could have been as-
serted. The risk of loss to the complainant by making such
advances would have been nothing. We refer to the subject
to show that the mere fact that the trustee was without actual
cash in hand to procure the insurance is not material.
Nor can we see that the execution of the agreement soon
after the court had decided to deny the application for the re-
ceiver, in any way affects the liability of the defendants on this
branch of the case. From the time that Kann bought the prem-
ises on the receiver's sale and took a deed therefor subject to

the mortgage, he denied any liability on his part to insure the
premises for, the bondholders, and refused so to do, and The
Penn Company from the time it became the purchaser of the
premises, also denied any liability to insure and refused to do
it. The denial of this obligation to insure and the refusal on
the part of both Kann and The Penn Company had been ex-
plicit, open and continuous from the time the property had first
been acquired up to the bearing upon the motion for a receiver.
Whether the defendants or either of them were bound to in-
sure for the benefit of the bondholders was a question which
the Circuit Court said it could not decide at that time. This
was after the court had stated its determination to deny the
motion for a receiver. Finally it was agreed between counsel
who were then before the court that Kann and Wertheimer
would sign an agreement that in the event of a loss bjr fire there
should be paid to complainant out of the policies of insurance
existing in favor of The. Penn Company a sum equal to the
total amount of valid bonds secured by the mortgage, provided
it was finally adjudicated that the company, the then owner
of the.property, was bound or liable by anything contained in'
the mortgage or the terms of its purchase of the described mort-
gaged premises, to keep and mainthin insurance for the benefit
of the holders of boids secured by the mortgage.
We do not see that this agreement altered in any dgree or
added to the rights or obligations of the defendants in regard
to insurance on the premises. The agreement simply was that
if the defendants were bound to insure, then they would take
moneys arising from the insurance policies sufficient to pay the
bonds. Whether they were or, were not so liable was not de-
termined or in any way intimated. If the court had then de-
cided that they were liable, they would have had the opportunity,
of placing the necessary amount of insurance to cover the in-
terest of the bondholders in addition to that which The Penn
Company then had covering its own interest, but no such de-
cision was arrived at and no such order was made and no extra'
or other insurance taken out, and all parties seemed to be con-
tent to rest upon their legal rights and to take the risk of an
error as to what those rights were: To make a decree after a

loss has happened, by which the moneys arising from policies
covering only the interest of The Penn Company and procured
by it as security for such interest against the loss of property
by fire, requires the existence of an obligation on the part of
that company founded upon considerati6ns other than the fact
that it had opposed the appointment of a receiver, and that the
agreement had been made in the circumstances mentioned. In
our view there are no facts disclosed by this record which au-
thorize or justify the court in regarding the defendants in the
same light as if they were receivers appointed upon the motion
made by complainant in this suit and as such had taken out
these policies. The court with all the facts before it refused to
appoint such receiver, and the fact that these defendants, Kann
and The Penn Company, successfully opposed the appointment,
furnishes no tenable ground to regard them as receivers because
of such successful opposition. This ground of liability must,
therefore, be rejected.
While it is true that as a consequence of this voluntary agree-
ment entered into by Kann and Wertheimer, the latter was ap-
pointed a receiver to collect and hold a sufficient amount of
the insurance -moneys to pay these bonds, and in that way the
moneys may be described as being in court, yet the court did
not obtain jurisdiction to make any disposition of those mon-
eys in behalf of complainant except upon the conditions made
in the agreement, by virtue of which alone the moneys came
under its immediate control. Unless the court held that there
was a liability, as expressed in the agreement, it obtained no
jurisdiction over these moneys to make a disposition of them
in accordance with general equitable principles. There is no
fund in court to be thus disposed of. We must confine our-
selves, therefore, strictly to the question of whether there was
a.right on-the part -of the complainant to enforce the applica-
tion of these insurance moneys, in the hands of the companies
or of the defendant , to the payment of these bonds, and a cor-
responding liability of defendants to apply these moneys for
the benefit of the bondholders, free from any assumed power of
the court to-make a disposition of the funds on general equita-
ble principles because they-are ih its possession, and to that ex-
tent subject tp its immediate control.
