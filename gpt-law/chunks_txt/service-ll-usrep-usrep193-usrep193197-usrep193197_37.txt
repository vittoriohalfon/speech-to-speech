But put the proposition as it is put by appellants: Can Con-
gress regulate the ownership of interstate railroads under its
power to regulate commerce among the States, and has it done
so by this act of 1890? Most certainly, yes. Congress can
regulate anything and everything in the sense that it can pro-
hibit and prevent its use in a way that will defeat a law that
Congress may constitutionally enact. For this purpose, the
supreme power operates upon everything, upon every one.
No device of State or individual creation can be interposed
as a shield between the Federal authority and those who at-
tempt to subvert it. No rules of law which govern the rela-
tions which individuals have created inter sese, or which have
been assumed between themselves and a State, are to be con-
sidered in an issue between them and the United States to de-
feat the ends of a constitutional law. The Federal power
would not be supreme if the operation of its laws could be de-
feated, embarrassed, or impeded by any means whatsoever.
It is no violation of the reserved rights of the States, but, on
the contrary, is clearly within the Federal power for Congress
to enact that no persons, natural or artificial, shall form a
combination of the instrumentalities of any part of interstate
commerce the effect or tendency of which would be to restrain
interstate trade or commerce, and that no person or persons,
natural or artificial, shall acquire a monopoly of such instru-
mentalities. This is a natural and logical deduction from the
supreme, plenary, and exclusive nature of the power of the
Federal Government over foreign and interstate commerce,
in the exercise of which Congress may descend to the most
minute directions.
The "penetrating and all-embracing " nature of this power
has often been stated, explained, and emphasized by this
court. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 197, and see concurring
opinion of Johnson, J., also. The principles announced in

this case have never been departed from, but have been
reaffirmed time and again by this court, notably in Brown
v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419; Passenger Cases, 7 how. 283;
In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564; Champion v. Ames, 188 U. S. 321;
Stockton v. Baltimore & N. Y. R. Co., 32 Fed. Rep. 11, '16.
The fact that in recent years interstate commerce has come
to be carried on by railroads and over artificial highways has
in no manner narrowed the scope of the constitutional pro-
vision or abridged the power of Congress over such com-
merce. On the contrary, the same fullness of control exists
in the one case as in the other, and the same power to remove
obstructions from the one as from the other.
Of course, it makes no difference whether the obstruction
be physical or economie-whether it be a sand bar, a mob, or
a monopoly-whether it result from the sinking of a vessel or
the stifling of competition-the power of Congress to remove
it is the same in each case. Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 Wall.
713, 724.
On these subjects the state legislatures have no jurisdiction.

Shore &c. Ry. Co., 84 N. Y. 157, 185.
Congress has the power to legislate upon the subject of con-
solidations of railroad corporations when the consolidations
form interstate lines; in the absence of legislation by Congress,
the power exists in the States to legislate upon the subject, but
in the presence of legislation by Congress the power of the
States over the subject is excluded. Noyes on Intercorporate
Relations, ยง 19, citing Louisville & Nashville v. Kentucky,
supra.
This exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Government over
commerce with foreign nations and among the States, and
over the instrumentalities of such commerce, includes the
power of police, or, that which is its equivalent, over those
subjects in all its undefined breadth and fullness and which
is just as full, complete, and far-reaching as is the police power
of the state legislatures with reference to subjects within the,

exclusive jusridiction of the States. In either case there are
no limitations to its exercise, except the constitutional guar-
anties in favor of life, liberty, and property. Thayer's Cases
on Const. Law, 742, note; Cooley's Const. Lim. 723; Noyes on
Intercorp. Rel. ยง 409.
Anti-trust statutes are enacted in the exercise of the police,
or an analogous, power. State v. Firemen's Fund Ins. Co., 152
Missouri, 46; State v. Schlitz Brewing Co., 104 Tennessee, 715;
Waters-Pierce Co. v. State, 19 Tex. Civ. App. 1.
Congress having the police power, or its equivalent, over
foreign and interstate commerce and the instrumentalities
thereof, may in exercising it, strike down restraints upon such
commerce, whether they result from combinations and mo-
nopolies of the agencies of transportation or otherwise, just
as a State could prohibit similar restraints upon interstate
commerce. To contend otherwise is to contend that the
Federal power over interstate and foreign commerce is not
supreme, but is in some respects subordinate to state author-
ity; that the police powers or the reserved powers of the States
are, for some purposes, paramount to the powers of Congress
in fields wherein the Federal Government has been invested
by the Constitution with complete and supreme authority.
This, of course, is not so. New Orleans Gas Co. v. Louisiana
Light Co., 115 U. S. 650, 661.
The Louisville & Nashville Case, supra, does not hold that
Congress has no power to prohibit the consolidation of com-
peting interstate railroads. Congress has created "the in-
struments of such commerce," and it has passed regulations
concerning them, and the power to do these things is now
unquestioned. Calijorniav . Pacific Railway Co., 127 U. S. 1.
What the court meant in the Louisville Case was that in re-
spect of matters of a local nature, which did not admit or
require uniform regulation, the States may "regulate the
instruments of such commerce" until Congress legislates on
the same subjects, while in respect of matters of national
importance, or which admit of uniform regulation, the power
