to their various customers in the different States tributary to
the Kansas City market, and that the section is a part of the
contract between the members of the exchange, and is clearly
an attempt to regulate and restrict the sending of messages
by telegraph and telephone between citizens of the various
States and Territories, and operates upon and directly affects
the interstate business of communicating between points in
different States by telegraph or telephone.
An agreement among the defendants to abstain from tele-
graphing in certain circumstances and for certain purposes
is so clearly not an attempt to regulate or restrain the gen-
eral sending of telegrams that it would seem unnecessary
to argue the question. An agreement among business men
not to send telegrams in regard to their business in certain
contingencies, when the agreement is entered into only for
the purpose of regulating the business of the individuals, is
not a direct attempt to affect the business of the telegraph
company, and has .no direct effect thereon. Although com-
munication by telegraph may be commerce, and if carried on
between different States may be commerce among the
several States, yet an agreement or by-law of the nature of
the one under consideration is not a burden or a regulation of
or a duty laid upon the telegraph company, and was clearly
not entered into for the purpose of affecting in the slightest
degree the company itself or its transaction of interstate
commerce.
The argument of counsel in behalf of the United States,
that because none of the States or Territories could enact
any law interfering with or abridging the right of persons
in Kansas or Missouri to send prepaid telegrams of the nat-
ure in question, therefore an agreement to that effect entered
into between business men as a means towards the proper
transaction of their legitimate business would be void, is, as
we think, entirely unsound. 'The conclusion does not follow
from the facts stated. The statute might be illegal as an
improper attempt to interfere with- the liberty of transactihg
legitimate business enjoyed by the citizen, while the agree-
ment among business men for the better conduct of their own

business, as they think, to refrain from using the telegraph
for certain purposes, is a matter purely. for their own consid-
eration. There is no similarity between the two cases, and
the principle existing in the one is wholly absent in the other.
The private agreement does not, as we have said, regulate
commerce or impose any impediment upon it or tax it. Com-
munication by telegraph is free from any burden so far as
this agreement is concerned, and no restrictions are placed on
the commerce itself.
The act of Congress must have a reasonable construction or
else there would scarcely be an agreement or contract among
business men that could not be said to- have, indirectly or re-
motely, some bearing upon interstate commerce, and possibly
to restrain it. We have no idea that the act covers or was
intended to cover such kinds of agreements.
The next by-law which complainants object to is section 10
of the same rule 9, which prohibits the hiring of a solicitor
except upon a stipulated salary not contingent upon commis-
sions earned, and which provides that no more than three
solicitors shall be employed at one time by a commission firm
or corporation.
The claim is that these solicitors are engaged in interstate
commerce, and that such commerce must be free from any
state legislation and free from the control or restraint by any
person or combination of persons. They also object that the.
rule is an unlawful inhibition upon the privilege possessed by
each person under the Constitution to make lawful contracts
in the furtherance of his business, and they allege that in this
respect these- members have surrendered their dominion over
their own business and permitted the exchange to establish a
species of regency, and that the by-law in regard to the em-
ployment of solicitors is one which directly affects interstate
commerce.
Mc Call v. California, 136 U. S. 104, is cited for the propo-.
sition that the solicitors employed by these defendants are
engaged in interstate commerce. In that case the railroad
company was itself engaged in such commerce, and its agent
in California was taxed by reason of his business in soliciting

for his company that which was interstate commerce. The
fact that he did not sell tickets or receive or pay out money
on account of it was not regarded as material. His principal
was a common carrier, engaged in interstate corimerce, and
he was engaged in that commerce because he was soliciting
for the transportation of passengers by that company through
the different States in which the railroad ran from the State
of California. In the case before us the defendants ate not
employed in interstate commerce but are simply engaged in
the performance of duties or services relating to stock upon
its arrival at Kansas City. We do not think it can be properly
said that the agents of the defendants whom they send out
to solicit the various owners of stock to consign the cattle to
one of the defendants for sale are thereby themselves engaged
in interstate commerce. They are simply soliciting the vari-
ous stock owners to consign the stock owned by them to par-
ticular defendants at Kansas City, and until the arrival of the
stock at that point and the delivery by the transportation
company no duties of an interstate-commerce nature arise to
be performed by the defendants. As the business they do'is
not interstate commerce, the business of their agents in solicit-
ing others to give them such business is not itself interstate
commerce. Not being engaged in interstate commerce, the
agreement, of the defendants through ,the by-law in question,
restricting the number of solicitors to three, does not restrain
that commerce, and does ilot therefore violate the act of Con-
gress under discussion.
The position of the solicitors is entirely different from that
of drummers who are travelling through the severdl States for.
the purpose of getting orders for the purchase of property.
It was said in Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District,
120 U. S. 489, that the negotiation of sales of goods which
are in another State for the purpose of introducing them
into the State in which the negotiation is made is interstate
commerce.
But the solicitors for these defendants have no property or
goods for sale, and their only duty is to ask or induce those
who own the property to agree that when they send it to
