OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.
combination in question was formed, may not, in view of the
facts disclosed, be effectual to accomplish the object of the act
of 1890, I perceive no difficulty in the way of the court passing
a decree declaring that that combination imposes an unlawful
restraint upon trade and commerce among the States, and per-
petually enjoining it from further prosecuting any business
pursuant to the unlawful agreements under which it was
formed or by which it was created. Such a decree would be
within the scope of the bill, and is appropriate to the end
which Congress intended to accomplish, namely, to protect the
freedom of commercial intercourse among the States against
combinations and conspiracies which impose unlawful restraints
upon such intercourse.
For the reasons stated I dissent from the opinion and judg-
ment of the court.
