FTC v. TICOR TITLE INS. CO.
REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting
at 351.1 "The Parkerd ecision was premised on the assump-
tion that Congress, in enacting the Sherman Act, did not
intend to compromise the States' ability to regulate their
domestic commerce." Southern Motor CarriersR ate Con-
ference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U. S.4 8, 56 (1985) (foot-
note omitted).
We developed our present analysis for state-action immu-
nity for private actors in CaliforniaR etail Liquor Dealers
Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S.9 7 (1980). We
held in Midcal that our prior precedent had granted state-
action immunity from antitrust liability to conduct by pri-
vate actors where a program was "clearly articulated and
affirmatively expressed as state policy [and] the policy [was]
actively supervised by the State itself." Id., at 105 (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). In Midcal, we found
the active supervision requirement was not met because
under the California statute at issue, which required liquor
retailers to charge a certain percentage above a price
"posted" by area wholesalers, "[t]he State has no direct con-
trol over wine prices, and it does not review the reasonable-
ness of the prices set by wine dealers." Id., at 100. We
noted that the state-action defense does not allow the States
to authorize what is nothing more than private price fixing.
Id., at 105.
In each instance since Midcal in which we have concluded
that the active supervision requirement for state-action im-
munity was not met, the state regulators lacked authority,
under state law, to review or reject the rates or action taken
1 The Court states that "[c]ontinued enforcement of the national anti-
trust policy grants the States more freedom, not less, in deciding whether
to subject discrete parts of the economy to additional regulations and con-
trols," ante, at 632. However, in Parker, we held that the Sherman Act
simply does not apply to conduct regulated by the State. The enforce-
ment of the national antitrust policy, as embodied in the antitrust laws,
may grant individuals more freedom to compete in our free market sys-
tem, but it does not implicate the freedom of the States in deciding
whether to regulate.

by the private actors facing antitrust liability.2 Our most
recent formulation of the "active supervision" requirement
was announced in Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94 (1988),
where we concluded that to satisfy the "active supervision"
requirement, "state officials [must] have and exercise power
to review particular anticompetitive acts of private parties
and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy."
Id., at 101. Until today, therefore, we have never had occa-
sion to determine whether a state regulatory program which
gave state officials authority-"power"-to review and regu-
late prices or conduct, might still fail to meet the require-
ment for active state supervision because the State's regula-
tion was not sufficiently detailed or rigorous.
Addressing this question, the Court of Appeals in this case
used the following analysis:
"'Where, as here, the state's program is in place, is
staffed and funded, grants to the state officials ample
power and the duty to regulate pursuant to declared
standards of state policy, is enforceable in the state's
courts, and demonstrates some basic level of activity di-
rected towards seeing that the private actors carry out
the state's policy and not simply their own policy, more
need not be established."' 922 F. 2d 1122, 1136 (CA3
1991), quoting New England Motor Rate Bureau, Inc.
v. FTC, 908 F. 2d 1064, 1071 (CA1 1990).
The Court likens this test to doing away all together with
the active supervision requirement for immunity based on
state action. But the test used by the Court of Appeals is
2I n 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U. S. 335 (1987), we held that a New
York statute failed to shelter private actors from antitrust liability be-
cause the state legislation required retailers to charge 112% of the price
"posted" by wholesalers. The New York statute, like the California stat-
ute at issue in CaliforniaR etail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Alumi-
num, Inc., 445 U. S. 97 (1980), gave no power to the state agency to review
or establish the reasonableness of the price schedules "posted" by the
wholesalers. 324 Liquor, supra,a t 345.

much more closely attuned to our "have and exercise power"
formulation in Patrick v. Burget than is the rule adopted by
the Court today. The Court simply does not say just how
active a State's regulators must be before the "active super-
vision" requirement will be satisfied. The only guidance it
gives is that the inquiry should be one akin to causation in
a negligence case; does the State play "a substantial role
in determining the specifics of the economic policy." Ante,
at 635. Any other formulation, we are told, will remove
the active supervision requirement altogether as a practical
matter.
I do not believe this to be the case.3 In the States at issue
here, the particular conduct was approved by a state agency.
The agency manifested this approval by raising no objection
to a required rate filing by the entity subject to regulation.
This is quite consistent with our statement that the active
supervision requirement serves mainly an "evidentiary func-
tion" as "one way of ensuring that the actor is engaging in
the challenged conduct pursuant to state policy." Hallie v.
Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34, 46 (1985).
The Court insists that its newly required "active supervi-
sion" will "increase the States' regulatory flexibility." Ante,
at 636. But if private actors who participate, through a
joint rate filing, in a State's "negative option" regulatory
scheme may be liable for treble damages if they cannot prove
that the State approved the specifics of a filing, the Court
makes it highly unlikely that private actors will choose to
participate in such a joint filing. This in turn lessens the
States' regulatory flexibility, because as we have noted be-
fore, joint rate filings can improve the regulatory process
by ensuring that the state agency has fewer filings to con-
sider, allowing more resources to be expended on each filing.
3T he state regulatory programs in Midcal, supra, Patrick v. Burget,
486 U. S. 94 (1988), and 824 Liquor, supra, would all fail to provide immu-
nity for lack of active supervision under the test adopted by the Court
of Appeals.
