strued) had been violated. This presents a controversy be-
tween the appellant and the defendants, the correct determi.
nation of which involves or depends upon the construction
and the application of the commerce clause as well as Arti-
cle IV of the Constitution of the United States.
An issue wyas tendered in which the appellant alleged the
commission of certain acts by the defendants which were
specifically asserted to be not only seriously injurious to its
proprietary -interest, but in violation of the Federal Anti-
Trust Act, and the learned trial court iq its decision actually
construed the act adversely to one contention of appellant and
this construction rendered it unnecessary for the court to
construe the act with reference to the other questions sub-
mitted. In this portion of the decree the court construed the
act as excluding the appellant from invoking equity jurisdic-
tion for its enforcement. Again, upon the argument in this
court appellant's contentions upon both propositions were
strenuously opposed by counsel for appellees.
It is therefore submitted that the pending controversy is one
in part "arising under and depending upon the construction
of the laws of the United States." Cases cited supra, and
Cummings v. Chicago, 188 U. S. 410; Defiance WaterCo. V.
Defiance, 191 U. S. 184; N. P. Railway Co. v. Townsend, 190
U.-S. 270.
The test as to jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is clearly
stated in the opinion of the court in Gold-IWashing & Water
Co. v. Keyes, supra, and affirmed in the case of Shoshone
Mining Co. y. Rutter, supra, see p. 507; Railroad Company v.

â€¢I f this construction of the act of Congress obtains in the
application of the rule' invoked, it is clear from the record that
the State has suffered, and will continue from year to year to

vania v. Wheeling Bridge Co., 13 How. 518.
Upon the proposition that a State may sue to redress in-
juries which are strictly analogous to those suffered by private
individuals, see United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., 125 U. S.
273; United States v. Am. Bell Tel. Co., 128 U. S. 315, 317;
Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U. S. 240; Kansas v. Colorado, 185
U. S. 125.
The violation of the Minnesota Anti-Consolidation and
Anti-Trust Act, rightfully construed, involves, as applied to
this controversy, the construction and the application of
Article IV of the Federal Constitution, as well as the com-
merce clause. For history of the clause, see Elliott's De-
bates, vol. 4, 123, vol. 5, 487, 504.
The gravamen of the charge in appellant's complaint is that
the defendants created a corporate device in New Jersey and
used it for the purpose and with the result that property rights
in Minnesota were affected, in violation of its laws. Our con-
tention is that Article IV must be so construed as to make the
constitutional enactments of Minnesota effective throughout
the United States, so far as they apply to and affect property
rights within the State. Otherwise the ,policy and laws of any
State may be easily evaded.
The test of jurisdiction must necessarily be determined by a
correct answer to the question: What issues were fairly ten-
dered for determination by the bill of complaint? If this be
not the test, the trial court, by misconstruing a statute, has
the power to eliminate from the record a jurisdictional ques-
tion and deprive a party of the right of appeal.
The question of whether or not the case was properly re-
moved fron the state to the Federal court, is in itself a Fed-
eral question. Railroad Company v. Koontz, 104 U. S. 15.
The determination of this question in itself gives the right of
appeal to this court direct.
The case having been appealed to this court, and this court,

on its own motion, having questioned the correctness 6f the
removal from the state to the Federal court, that establishes
the jurisdiction of this court on appeal over the entire case
should this court determine that the case was properly re-
moved from the state to the Federal court. Oakley v. Good-
now, 118 U. S. 44; Scott v. Goodnow, 165 U. S. 58; Carter v.
Texas, 177 U. S. 442.
Mr. John G. Johnson, and Mr. George B. Young, with whom
Mr. M. D. Grover and Mr. C. W. Bunn were on the brief, for
appellees:
On the question of removal to and jurisdiction of the Cir-
cuit Court:
The cause was properly removed to the Circuit Court, and
upon such removal that court acquired jurisdiction of it as a
"suit arising under the Constitution and laws of the United
States."
As to the test of such a suit as determined by Chief Justice
Marshall, see Osborn v. Bank, 9 Wheat. 738, 822, in which it
was held that a cause may depend upon several questions of
fact and law. Some of these may depend on the construction
of a law of the United States, others on principles unconnected
with that law. If it be a sufficient foundation for jurisdiction
that the title or right set up by the party may be defeated by
one construction of the Constitution or laws of the United
States and sustained by the opposite construction provided the
facts necessary to support the action be made out, then all the
other questions must be decided as incidental to this which gives
that jurisdiction. Under this construction, the judicial power
of the United States extends effectively and beneficially to that
most important class of cases which depends on the character
of the cause. See also Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 379.
The following cases were decided under the act of 1875:
Gold-Washing Co. v. Keyes, 96 U. S. 199, 201; Tennessee v.
Davis, 100 U. S. 257, 264; Railroad Co. v. Mississippi, 102
