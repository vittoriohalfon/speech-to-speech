CITIZENS' ST. RAILWAY v. DETROIT RAILWAY. 51
Opinion of the Court.
The controversy turns primarily upon the power of the city
of Detroit over its streets, whether original under the consti-
tution of *theS tate, and hence as extensive as it would be in
the legislature, or whether not original but conferred by the
legislature, and hence limited by the terms of the delegation.
The first proposition is asserted by the plaintiff in error;
the second proposition by the defendants in error.
The provisions of the constitution which are pertinent to
the case are as follows:
"The State shall not be a party to 6r interested in- any work
of internal improvement, nor engaged in carrying on any such
work, excepf in the expenditure of grants to the State of land
or other property.
"There shall be elected annually on the first Monday of
April in each organized township . . . one commissioner
of highways . . . and one overseer of highways for each
highway district.
"The legislature shall not vacate or alter any
road laid out by the commissioners of highways, or any street
in any city or village, or in any recorded town plat.
"The legislature may confer upon organized townships, in-
corporated cities and villages, and upon boards of supervisors
of the several counties such powers of a local, legislative and
administrative character as they may deem proper."
The Supreme Court of Michigan, in its opinion, 68 N. W.
Rep. 304, interprets these'provisions adversely to the conten-
tion of plaintiff in error, and, reviewing prior cases, declares
their harmony with the views expressed. "The scope of the
earlier decisions," the court said, "is clearly stated by Mr.
Justice Cooley in Park, Commissioners v. Common Council,
28 Michigan, 239. After stating that the opinion in People
v. -lurlbut had been misapprehended, Justice Cooley said:
'We intended in that case to concede most fully that the
State must determine for each of its municipal corporations
the powers it should exercise, and the capacities it should
possess, and that it must also decide what restrictions should
be placed upon these, as well to prevent clashing of action
and interest in the State as to protect individual corporators

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the. Court.
against injustice and oppressibn at the hands of the local
majority. And what we said in that case we here repeat -
that, while it is a fundamental principle in this State, recog-
nized and perpetuated by expressed provisions of theconstitu-
tion, that the people of every hamlet, town and city of the
State ar,& entitled to the benefits of local self-government, the
constitutibn has not pointed out the precise extent of local
powers and capacities, but has left them to be determined in
each case by the legislative authority of the State from con-
siderations of general policy, as well as those which pertain to
the local benefit and local desires. And in conferring those
powers it is not to be disputed that the legislature may give
extensive capacity to acquire and hold property for local pur-
poses or it may confine authority within the narrow bounds;
and what it thus confers it may enlarge, restrict or take away
at pleasure."
This decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan is persua-
sive if not authoritative; but, exercising an independent judg-
ment, we think it is a correct interpretation of the constitu-
tional .provisions. The common council of Detroit, therefore,
had no inherent power to confer the exclusive privilege
claimed by the plaintiff in error.
Did it get such power from the legislature? It is con-
tended that it did by the act under which the Detroit City
Railway Company, the predecessor of plaintiff in error, was.
organized, and to whose rights and franchises it succeeded.
This -act is the Tram Railway Act, and at the time of .the
adoption of, the first oridinance in 1862, section 34 of that
act provided that "c-all companies or corporations formed
for such. purposes [the railway purposes mentioned in the
act] shall have" the exclusive right to use and operate any
railways constructed, owned or held by them: Provided,
that no such company or corporation shall *be authorized to
construct a-railway, under this act, through the streets of any
town of city, without the consent of the municipal authorities
of such town or city, and under -such regulations and upon
such terms and conditions as said authorities may from time
to time prescribe."

CITIZENS' ST. RAILWAY v. DETROIT RAILWAY. 53
Opinion of the Court.
In 1867 the further proviso was added that, after such con-
sent should be given and accepted, such authorities should
make no regulations or conditions whereby the rights or fran-
chises so granted should be destroyed or dnreasonably im-
paired, or such company be deprived of the right of construct-
ing, maintaining and operating such railway.
It is clear that the statute did not explicitly and directly
confer the power on the municipality to grant an exclusive
privilege to occupy its streets for railway purposes. It is
urged, however, that' such power is to be inferred from
the provision which requires the consent of the munici-
pal authorities to the construction of a railway under such
terms as they may prescribe, combined with the provisions
of the constitution, which, if they do not confer a power in-
dependent of the legislature, strongly provide for and intend
local government. The argument is strong, and all of its
strength has been presented and is appreciated, but there
exist considerations of countervailing and superior strength.
That such power must be given in language explicit and ex-
press, or necessarily to be implied from other powers, is now
firmly fixed. There were many reasons which urged to
this -reasons which flow from the nature of the municipal
trust- even from the nature of the legislative trust, and
those which, without the clearest intention explicitly de-
clared- insistently forbid that the future should be com-
mitted and bound by the -onditions of the present time, and
functions delegated for public purposes be paralyzed in their
exercise by the existence of exclusive privileges. The rule
and the reason for it are expressed in 31 inturn v. Larue, 23
How. 435; WTright v. NVagle, 101 U. S. 791; State v. Cincin-
nati Gas Light and Coke Co., 18 Ohio St. 262; Pq rklIurst v.
Salem, 32 Pac. Rep. 304; Saginaw Gas Light Co. v. Saginaw,

court; Long v. Duluth, 51 N. W. Rep. 913. See also Grand
Rapids Electric Light and Power Co. v. Grand Rapids &fc.
Co., 33 Fed. Rep. 669, opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Jack-
son at circuit. As bearing on the rule, see also Oregon R'ail-
