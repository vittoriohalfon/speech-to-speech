sale of refined sugar in the United States, and controlled
the price of sugar, that in making the contracts, Searles
and the American Sugar Refining Company combined and
conspired with the other defendants to restrain trade and
commerce in refined sugar among the several States and
foreign nations, and that the said contracts were made with
the intent to enable the American Sugar Refining Company
to restrain the sale of refined sugar in Pennsylvania and
among the several States, and to increase the regular price at
which refined sugar was sold, and thereby to exact and secure
large sums of money from the State of Pennsylvania, and
from the other States of the United States, and from all other
purchasers, and that the same was unlawful and contrary to
the said act.
The bill called for answers under oath, and prayed -
"1. That all and each of the said unlawful agreements
made and entered into by and between the said defendants,
on or about the fourth day of March, 1892, shall be delivered
up, cancelled, and declared to be void, and that the said
defendants, the American Sugar Refining Company and
John E. Searles, Jr., be ordered to deliver to the other said
defendants respectively the shares of stock received by them
in performance of the said contracts, and that the other said
defendants be ordered to deliver to the said defendants, the
American Sugar Refining Company and John E. Searles, Jr.,
the shares of stock received by them respectively in perform-
ance of the said contracts.
"2. That an injunction issue preliminary until the final
determination of this cause, and perpetual thereafter, pre-
venting and restraining the said defendants from the further
performance of the terms and conditions of the said unlawful
agreements.
"3. That an injunction may issue preventing and restrain-
ing the said defendants from further and continued violations

sufficiently summarized by Judge Butler in his opinion in the
Circuit Court
"The material facts proved are that the American Sugar
Refining Co., one of the defendants, is incorporated under the
laws of New Jersey, and has authority to purchase, refine, and
sell sugar, that the Franklin Sugar Refinery, the E. C. Knight
Co., the Spreckels Sugar Refinery, and the Delaware Sugar
House, were incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania,
and authorized to purchase, refine, and sell sugar, that the
four latter Pennsylvania companies were located in Philadel-
phia, and prior to March, 1892, produced about thirty-three
per cent of the total amount of sugar refined in the United
States, and were in active competition with the American
Sugar Refining Co., and with each other, selling their product
wherever demand was found for it throughout the United
States, that prior to March, 1892, the American Sugar
Refining Co. had obtained control of all refineries in the
United States, excepting the four located in Philadelphia,
and that of the Revere Co. in Boston, the latter producing
about two per cent of the amount refined in this country,
that in March, 1892, the American Sugar Refining Co. entered
into contracts (on different dates) with the stockholders of
each of the Philadelphia corporations named, whereby it pur-
chased their stock, paying therefor by transfers of stock in
its company, that the American Sugar Refinig Co. thus
obtained possession of the Philadelphia refineries and their
business, that each of the purchases was made subject to the
American Sugar Refining Co. obtaining authority to increase
its stock $25,000,000, that this assent was subsequently ob-
tained and the increase made, that there was no understand-
ing or concert of action between the stockholders of the several
Philadelphia companies respecting the sales, but that those of
each company acted independently of those of the others, and
in ignorance of what was being done by such others, that the
stockholders of each company acted in concert with each other,
understanding and intending that all the stock and property
of the company should be sold, that the contract of sale in
each instance left the sellers free to establish other refineries

and continue the business if they should see fit to do so, and
contained no provision respecting trade or commerce in sugar,
and that no arrangement or provision on this subject has been
made since, that since the purchase the Delaware Sugar
House Refinery has been operated in conjunction with the
Spreckels Refinery, and the E. C. Knight Refinery in con-
nection with the Franklin, this combination being made
apparently for reasons of economy in conducting the business,
that the amount of sugar refined in Philadelphia has been in-
creased since the purchases, that the price has been slightly
advanced since that event, but is still lower than it had been
for some years before, and up to within a few months of the
sales, that about ten per cent of the sugar refined and sold
in the United States is refined in other refineries than those
controlled by the American Sugar Refining Co., that some
additional sugar is produced in Louisiana and some is brought
from Europe, but the amount is not large in either instance.
"The object in purchasing the Philadelphia refineries was
to obtain a greater influence or more perfect control over the
business of refining and selling sugar in this country"
The Circuit Court held that the facts did not show a con-
tract, combination, or conspiracy to restrain or monopolize
trade or commerce "among the several States or with foreign
nations," and dismissed the bill. 60 Fed. Rep. 306. The
cause was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit, and the decree affirmed. 60 Fed. Rep. 934. This
appeal was then prosecuted. The act of Congress of July 2,
1890, c. 647, is as follows
"An act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful
restraints and monopolies.
"SEc. 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust
or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby
declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any
such contract or engage in any such combination or con-
spiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on
conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding
five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one
