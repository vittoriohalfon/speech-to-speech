Argument of Mr. Johnson for Northern Securities Co. 1)3 U. S.
v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 U. S. 505, 567. A person or
corporation, by purchasing a majority of the shares of two
competing railway companies does not monopolize, or attempt
to monopolize, "any part of the trade or commerce among
the several States." As to what a monopoly is, see In re
Green, 52 Fed. Rep. 104; dissenting opinion of Story, J., in
Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 606: 20

ary, 435, and cases cited; Blackstone, Bk. IV, 159; Century
Dictionary.
The purchase by one person, of the property of his rival,
with the intention thereby to destroy his competition, is not
illegal, although by the purchase he will acquire the power to
prevent the same. Oregon Coal Co. v. lVin. or, 20 Wall. 64.
A person or corporation, by holding, as owner, the majority
of the shares of two competing railway companies, does not
monopolize, or attempt to monopolize "any part of the tra(le
or commerce among the several States."
The power of Congress to regulate commerce does not con-
fer upon it a right to prescribe the persons who may engage
therein, or to regulate, or to control, the ownership of shares
of stock of corporations engaging therein. United States v.
Knight, 156 U. S. 1; Louisville & Nashville v. Kentucky, 161
U. S. 677, 693.
The States create railroad corporations and may prescribe
the manner of issuance of their shares, and the nethod of
transfer of title thereto. In the use and operation of railroads
engaged in interstate commerce, the corporations owning the
same must submit to Federal jurisdiction but this does not in-
volve any right on the part of the United States to control
the transfer of shares by the shareholders, even though as a
result of said transfers the controlling interest may be trans-
ferred. It is not within the power of the Federal government
to destroy the title to property created by the State.
Congress has unrestricted power to prevent restraint or
monopolization of interstate commerce, as the authorities de-

fine those words, but not as the United States now claims.
Properly interpreted, the Sherman Act is constitutional but
the United States is now endeavoring to have its provisions
interpreted so as to be violative of States' rights. Such a
construction should not be adopted, if there is one which har-
monizes with the Constitution. Grenada County v. Brogden,
112 U. S. 261; Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U. S. 197.
The mere ownership of property cannot be an illegal re-
straint of trade. As to the power of the State over railroad
corporations, see Railroad' Co. v. Maryland, 21 Wall. 456;
Ashley v. Ryan, 153 U. S. 436.
The relief decreed by the lower court was improper under
any aspect of the case. United States v. Knight, 156 U.S. 1, 17.
Mr. Charles W. Bunn for appellant, Northern Pacific Rail-
way Company, argued:
The Sherman Act only declares those contracts illegal
which are in restraint of trade. The government cannot rest
on proof of combination and conspiracy but must establish
restraint of commerce and to do this must prove that the
ownership by one person of the stocks of two competing roads
is per se such restraint.
The statute must be interpreted so as to fall within the con-
stitutional powers of Congress which do not extend to de-
termine the ownership of stock in corporations or to the
regulation of consolidations of railroad companies chartered
by the States.
This power belongs to the States; Congress only has the
power to regulate the use of such property in commerce be-
tween the States. See definition of commerce in Gibbons v.
Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189, 196, as repeated by this court in Pas-
senger Cases, 7 How. 283, 394, 462; Henderson v. Mayor, 92
U. S. 259, 270; Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 346. Congress has
power only under ยง 8, Art. I, of the Constitution, and by
Amendment X all power not thus granted is reserved to the
States. Under the guise of regulating commerce Congress

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

cannot prescribe general rules as to transfer of real or personal
property or prohibit the purchase of stock and bonds because
when bought they may be used in a business carried on with
intent to monopolize or restrict interstate commerce. In re
Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104, 113, citing County of Mobile v. Kim-
ball, 102 U. S. 691, 702; Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania,
114 U. S. 196, 203; United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S.
1. The power of Congress extends only to those things that
directly and immediately pertain to conunerce; the powers
of the States include many things which operate indirectly
though importantly on commerce. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9
Wheat. 1, 203. For cases involving this demarkation between
national and state powers, see United States v. Joint Traffic
Association, 171 U. S. 505; Addyston Pipe Co. v. United States,
175 U. S. 211, 228; Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578,
592; Anderson v. United States, 171 U. S. 604, 615; Sherlock
v. Ailing, 93 U. S. 99; Louisville & Nashville v. Kentucky,
161 U. S. 677, 701. In the last case this court cites decisions
in which state statutes prohibiting or permitting consolida-
tion were enforced. This would have been erroneous if the
things complained of fell within the power of Congress, for
that power if it exists is exclusive of all state action, and
must be so in order that it be uniform. As to matters in re-
gard to which the States may act until Congress acts, see
Cooley v. Board of Port Wardens, 12 flow. 299; The James
Gray v. The John Fraser, 21 How. 184; Pound v. Turck, 95
U. S. 459; Robbins v. Shelby Taxing District, 120 U. S. 489,
492; and cases cited supra. No rule of law is introduced by the
Sherman Act; what was restraint of commerce is the same
now; the only feature of the act is making the preliminary
conspiracy a crime. The Constitution itself forbade restraint
of interstate commerce. In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564. A com-
bination that is restraint of trade now was restraint of trade
before the act of leasing, buying and consolidation of comi-
peting railroads has gone on for fifty years both before and
since the act of 1890.
