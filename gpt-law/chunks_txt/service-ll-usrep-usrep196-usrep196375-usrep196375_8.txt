and space, that something of the same impossibility applies to
them. The law has been uphehl, and therefore we are bound
to enforce it notwithstanding these difficulties. On the other
hand, we equally are bound by the first principles of justice
not to sanction a decree so vague as to put the whole conduct
of the defendants' business at the peril of a summons for con-'
tempt. We cannot issue a general injunction against all possi-
ble breaches of the law We must steer between these oppo-
site difficulties as best we can.
The scheme as a whole seems to us to be within reach of the
law The constituent elements, as we have stated them, are
enough to give to the scheme a body and, for all that we can
say, to accomplish it. Moreover, whatever we may think of
them separately when we take them up as distinct charges,
they are alleged sufficiently as elements of the schenme. It is
suggested that the several acts charged are lawful and that
intent can make no difference. But they are bound together
as the parts of a single plan. The plan may make the parts
unlawful. Aikens v Wiscormn, 195 U S. 194, 206. The
statute gives this proceeding against combinations in restraint
of commerce among the States and against attempts to mo-
nopolize the same. Intent is almost essential to such a com-
bination and is essential to such an attempt. Where acts are
not sufficient in themselves to produce a result which the law
seeks to prevent-for instance, the monopoly-but require
further acts in addition to the mere forces of nature to bring
that result to pass, an intent to bring it to pass is necessary in
order to produce a dangerous probability that it will happen.
Commonwealth v Peaslee, 177 Massachusetts, 267, 272. But
when that intent and the consequent dangerous probability
exist, this statute, like many others and like the common law
m some cases, directs itself against that dangerous probability
as well as against the completed result. What we have said
disposes incidentally of the objection to the bill as multifarious.
The unity of the plan embraces all the parts.
One further observation should be made. Although the

combination alleged embraces restraint and monopoly of trade
within a single State, its effect upon commerce among the
States is not accidental, secondary, remote or merely probable.
On the allegations of the bill the latter commerce no less,
perhaps even more, than commerce within a single State is an
object of attack. See Leloup v Port olM obile, 127 U S. 640,'
647, Crutcher v Kentucky, 141 U. S. 47, 59; Allen v Pulhnan
Co., 191 U S. 171, 179, 180. Moreover, it is a direct object,
it is that for the sake of which the several specific acts and
courses of conduct are done and adopted. Therefore the case
is not like United States v E. C. Knght Co., 156 U S. 1, where
the subject matter of the combination was manufacture and
the direct object monopoly of manufacture within a State.
However likely monopoly of commerce among the States in
the article manufactured was to follow from the agreement it
was not a necessary consequence nor a primary end. Here the
subject matter is sales and the very point of the combination
is to restrain and monopolize commerce among the States in
respect of such sales. The two cases are near to each other,
as sooner or later always must happen where lines are to be
drawn, but the line between them is distinct. Montague &
Co. v Lowry, 193 U S. 38.
So, again, the line is distinct between this case and Hopksns
v United States, 171 U S. 578. All that was decided there
was that the local business of commission merchants was not
commerce among the States, even if what the brokers were
employed to sell was an object of such commerce. The brokers
were not like the defendants before us, themselves the buyers
and sellers. They only furnished certain facilities for the
sales. Therefore, there again the effects of the combination
of brokers upon the commerce was only indirect and not
within the act. Whether the case would have been different
if the combination had resulted in exorbitant charges, was
left open. In Anderson v United Slates, 171 U S. 604, the
defendants were buyers and sellers at the stock yards, but
their agreement was merely not to employ brokers, of to

recognize yard-traders, who were not members of their asso-
ciation. Any yard-trader could become a member of the
association on complying with the conditions, and there was
said to be no feature of monopoly in the case. It was hehl
that the combination did not directly regulate commerce be-
tween the States, and, being formed with a different intent,
was not within the act. The present case is more like Monta-
gue & Co. v Lowry, 193 U S. 38.
For the foregoing reasons we are of opinion that the carrying
out of the scheme alleged, by the means set forth, properly
may be enjoined, and that the bill cannot be dismissed.
So far it has not been necessary to consider whether the
facts charged in any single paragraph constitute commerce
among the States or show an interference with it. There can
be no doubt, we apprehend, as to the collective effect of all
the facts, if true, and if the defendants entertain the intent
alleged. We pass now to the particulars, and will consider
the corresponding parts of the injunction at the same time.
The first question arises on the sixth section. That charges
a combination of independent dealers to restrict the coinpeti-
tion of their agents when purchasing stock for them in the
stock yards. The purchasers and their slaughtering estab-
lishments are largely in different States from those of the
stock yards, and the sellers of the cattle, perhaps it is not too
much to assume, largely in different States from either. The
intent of the combination is not merely to restrict competition
among the parties, but, as we have said, by force of the general
allegation at the end of the bill, to aid in an attempt to mo-
nopolize commerce among the States.
It is said that this charge is too vague and that it does not
set forth a case of commerce among the States. Taking up
the latter objection first, commerce among the States is not a
technical legal conception, but a practical one, drawn from
the course of business. When cattle are sent for sale from a
place in one State, with the expectation that they will end
their transit, after purchase, in another, and when in effect
