HARLAN, J., Affirming Decree. 193 U. S.
record that under the leadership of the defendants Hill and
Morgan the stockholders of the Great Northern and North-
ern Pacific Railway corporations, having competing and sub-
stantially parallel lines from the Great Lakes and the Miss-
issippi River to the Pacific Ocean at Puget Sound combined and
conceived the scheme of organizing a corporation under the
laws of New Jersey, which should hold the shares of the stock
of the constituent companies, such shareholders, in lieu of
their shares in those companies, to receive, upon an agreed
basis of value, shares in the holding corporation; that pursu-
ant to such combination the Northern Securities Company
was organized as the holding corporation through which the
scheme should be executed; and under that scheme such hold-
ing corporation has become the holder-more properly speak-
ing, the custodian-of more than nine-tenths of the stock of
the Northern Pacific, and more than three-fourths of the stock
of the Great Northern, the stockholders of the companies who
delivered their stock receiving upon the agreed basis shares of
stock in the holding corporation. The stockholders of these
two competing companies disappeared, as such, for the moment,
but immediately reappeared as stockholders of the holding
company which was thereafter to guard the interests of both
sets of stockholders as a unit, and to manage, or cause to be
managed, both lines of railroad as if held in one ownerdship.
Necessarily by this combination or arrangement the holding
company in the fullest sense dominates the situation in the in-
terest of those who were stockholders of the constituent com-
panies; as much so, for every practical purpose, as if it had been
itself a railroad corporation which had built, owned, and oper-
ated both lines for the exclusive benefit of its stockholders.
Necessarily, also, the constituent companies ceased, under such
a combination, to be in active competition for trade and com-
merce along their respective lines, and have become, practi-
cally, one powerful consolidated corporation, by the name of a
holding corporation the principal, if not the sole, object for the
formation of which was to carry out the purpose of the original

combination under which competition between the constituent
companies would cease. Those who were stockholders of the
Great Northern and Northern Pacific and became stockhold-
ers in the holding company are now interested in preventing
all competition between the two lines, and as owners of stock
or of certificates of stock in the holding company, they will
see to it that no competition is tolerated. They will take
care that no persons are chosen directors of the holding com-
pany who will permit competition between the constituent
companies. The result of the combination is that all the
earnings of the constituent companies make a common fund
in the hands of the Northern Securities Company to be dis-
tributed, not upon the basis of the earnings of the respective
constituent companies, each acting exclusively in its own in-
terest, but upon the basis of the certificates of stock issued
by the holding company. No scheme or device could more
certainly come within the words of the act--" combination in
the form of a trust or otherwise . . . in restraint of com-
merce among the several States or with foreign nations,"-
or could more effectively and certainly suppress free competi-
tion between the constituent companies. This combination
is, within the meaning of the act, a "trust;" but if not, it is a
combination in restraint of interstate and international com-
merce; and that is enough to bring it under the condemnation
of the act. The mere existence of such a combination and the
power acquired by the holding company as its trustee, consti-
tute a menace to, and a restraint upon, that freedom of com-
merce which Congress intended to recognize and protect, and
which the public is entitled to have protected. If such com-
bination be not destroyed, all the advantages that would
naturally come to the public under the operation of the gen-
eral laws of competition, as between the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific Railway companies, will be lost, and the en-
tire commerce of the immense territory in the northern part
of the United States between the Great Lakes and the Pacific
at Puget Sound will be at the mercy of a single holding cor-

poration, organized in a State distant from the people of that
territory.
The Circuit Court was undoubtedly right when it said-all
the Judges of that court concurring-that the combination re-
ferred to "led inevitably to the following results: First, it
placed the control of the two roads in the hands of a single
person, to wit, the Securities Company, by virtue of its owner-
ship of a large majority of the stock of both companies; sec-
ond, it destroyed every motive for competition between two
roads engaged in interstate traffic, which were natural com-
petitors for business, by pooling the earnings of the two rolds
for the common benefit of the stockholders of both com-
panies." 120 Fed. Rep. 721, 724.
Such being the case made by the record, what are the prin-
ciples that must control the decision of the present case? Do
former adjudications determine the controlling questions
raised by the pleadings and proofs?
The contention of the Government is that, if regard be had
to former adjudications, the present case must be determined
in its favor. That view is contested and the defendants insist
that a decision in their favor will not be inconsistent with
anything heretofore decided and would be in harmony with
the act of Congress.
Is the act to be construed as forbidding every combination
or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the
States or with foreign nations? Or, does it embrace only such
restraints as are unreasonable in their nature? Is the motive
with which a forbidden combination or conspiracy was formed
at all material when it appears that the necessary tendency of
the particular combination or conspiracy in question is to re-
strict or suppress free competition between competing rail-
roads engaged in commerce among the States? Does the act
of Congress prescribe, as a rule for interstate or international
commerce, that the operation of the natural laws of competi-
tion between those engaged in such commerce shall not be
restricted or interfered with by any contract, combination or
