the part of the defendants; much less was it any violation of tle
Sherman Anti Trust Act. There is here no sufficient showing
of an attempt to monopolize either the interstate transportation
of live stock or fresh meats or interstate trade in live stock or
fresh meats. The paragraph is multifarious, and there is
therein a nusjoinder of causes and parties.
As to the eleventh paragraph we submit that it is too gen-
eral and insufficient to require argument. It is disposed of
by what has been urged as to previous paragraphs.
Prior rulings by this court in cases arising under the Sher-
man Act do not sustain the Government's case here.
With respect to the supposed limitations of the Sherman
Act upon the right of private contract, that act is to be in-
terpreted in the light of the principles of the common law

The bill is too general and indefinite to require answer.
It does not sufficiently set forth definite or specific facts.
The demurrers to so much of the bill as prays for answer

Day, Assistait to the Attorney General, was on the brief, for
the United States:
The facts show a combination which restrains or monopolizes
trade or commerce and operates upon and directly affects in-
terstate or foreign trade or commerce.
The combination or conspiracy which the Government is
seeking to destroy and which it was the aim of the petition in
this case to set forth is one between all the principal American
producers or packers of fresh meats for the purpose of jointly
controlling the market for those products throughout the
entire United States so as to maintain uniform prices therefor
and destroy competition in the sale thereof to dealers and
consumers.
The combination set forth in the bill is in restraint of trade,
for if in the entire field of the law concerning monopolies and
restraints of trade there is a single proposition to which all
courts now yield assent, it is that a combination, conspiracy,
or agreement between independent manufacturers or producers
of a necessary of life to fix and maintain uniform prices for their
products, or otherwise to suppress competition with each other,
is an unlawful restraint upon trade. United States v E. C.

bination of conspiracy are inseparable parts of the combination
or conspiracy itself, and along with it fall within the condemna-
tion of the law
The combination or conspiracy in controversy operates upon
interstate or foreign commerce, and its operations are not con-
fined to commerce carried on wholly within state lines.
The sales of live stock to the defendants and the sales by
them of the prepared meats are interstate and not intrastate
transactions.
As to what is interstate commerce, see Gibbons v Ogden, 9
Wheat. 1, 194, Northern Securities Co. v United States, 193
U. S. 197, 337 If interstate commerce is commerce which
concerns more States than one, and if a combination of inde-
pendent producers to suppress competition between its iieii-
bers is a restraint upon commerce, it must follow that a com-
bination of independent producers to fix and control prices
and suppress competition between each other in an area cover-
ing more States than one is in restraint of interstate commerce
and the petition in this case discloses such a combination.
It is impossible to say with even a color of reason that the
facts stated in the bill, which cannot be denied, do not show
a combination between the defendants to suppress competition
between themselves in an area embracing more States than
one and it is immaterial to inquire whether the particular
purchases and sales made by the defendants are, technically,
interstate or intrastate transactions. There is nothing un-
reasonable or novel in the conclusion that a combination may
restrain interstate commerce, although the individual trans-
actions of its members might, standing alone and viewed
separate and apart from the purpose and necessary effect of
the whole combination, be intrastate in character. Montaguze
& Co. v Lowry, 193 U S. 38. The character of a combination
-that is, whether or not it is interstate in its operation-s de-
cided, not by the nature of the particular transactions of its
individual members, but by the extent of the territory in
which it operates-in which it controls prices and sales and
