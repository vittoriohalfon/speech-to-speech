the same is true of the other products. On the other hand, the
unoccupied or sparsely populated country along the line, or
reached by it, could not furnish a market for commodities
enough to load the returning cars; the result being that unless
the company could secure traffic for carriage beyond the Pacific
coast no great traffic either way could exist or be created.
To meet these conditions the Great Northern Company not
only went to great additional expense in the construction of its
line to obtain gradients lower than those of any other line to
the Pacific coast, but also made great efforts to create and
increase in the countries of eastern Asia a demand for the
products of this country; and soon after the completion of its
railway in 1893 it induced a Japanese company to run a line of
steamships, connecting with its railway, on the route between
Seattle and ports of Japan, China, and Russian Siberia, and
succeeded in creating and has since been actively engaged in
building up a commerce in which the flour manufactured along
its line, cotton (both raw and manufactured), iron anl steel
(especially steel rails and plates), machinery, and such other
manufactures of this country as a market could be found or
made for in eastern Asia, have been carried to oriental ports,
and return cargoes of such oriental products as are consumed
in this country have been brought back. A large west-bound,
as well as an increased east-bound, traffic has thus been secured
by the company, enabling it to make such-rates on lumber and
other products of the country served by it as permit them to be
shipped to Eastern markets with a profit to the shippers.
One year before the Burlington purchase, this oriental traffic
had reached such proportions that the Great Northern Company
caused to be begun the construction of steamships to run from
Seattle to ports in Japan, China, and the Philippines, which,
from their great carrying capacity (being the largest in the
world), will be able to carry at very low rates (if full cargoes
can be secured), and thus enable the company to move the
largest volume of west-bound traffic (and also of east-bound
traffic) at the lowest cost.

193 U. S. Answer of Northern Securities Company.
In the interstate and international commerce which the
Great Northern Company has thus built up, it competes both
in this country and on the ocean with the other transconti-
nental lines (including the Canadian Pacific), and at the oriental
ports it competes for commerce of the world. Its rates are and
must be made in competition with the rates of ocean carriers
and by way of the Suez Canal.
The policy thus followed by the Great Northern Company in
building up an international, and thereby interstate, commerce
has been followed by the Northern Pacific Company since its
reorganization in 1896.
In creating and maintaining this competitive interstate and
international commerce both the Great Northern Company and
the Northern Pacific Company were hampered and placed at a
disadvantage with the other transcontinental railways, as well
as with European competitors, by the want of sufficient direct
connection with the territory offering the best markets for the
products of the country along their lines, and with the places
of production and great centers of distribution from which their
traffic must be supplied. For many months before the pur-
chase of the Burlington shares they had considered the best
means of getting closer to such markets and sources of supply.
The lines of the Burlington, better than those of any other
company, fulfilled the requirements of both the Great Northern
Company and the Northern Pacific Company in respect of
markets for east-bound and freight for west-bound traffic.
The Burlington lines traverse the treeless States of Illinois,
Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Wyoming, Kansas, and Colorado,
which afford the best markets for the lumber of the Pacific coast.
They reach Denver, Kansas City, Omaha, and Aurora, where
are located the principal smelters of silver-lead ores, such as
are mined near the lines of the defendant railway companies.
They reach Omaha, Kansas City, and Chicago, where are the
great packing houses and the great markets for the cattle and
sheep of the ranges of North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming,
Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.

They reach St. Louis and Kansas City, connecting there with
lines traversing the cotton States, from which come raw and
manufactured cotton required for shipment to China and Japan.
At Chicago and St. Louis they connect with the lines which
reach the points of supply of manufactured iron, steel, ma-
chinery, and other manufactured articles that find a market
in Japan and China.
The Burlington line southward from Minneapolis and St.
Paul along the Mississippi River reaches the great coal deposits
of southern Illinois, the largest west of Pennsylvania and West
Virginia; and its light gradients and consequent low cost. of
transportation make it possible to supply such coal to points on
the lines of each defendant railway company east of the Mis-
souri River, relieving the people and the railways of that terri-
tory from entire dependence upon the Pennsylvania and West.
Virginia mines, the supply from which is yearly becoming more
costly and less certain.
The price paid for said Burlington stock was lower per mile
of main track covered by the stock than that for which the
stock of any other large and well established system in the same
general territory could have then been bought.
The purchase of the Burlington stock by the Northern Pacific
and Great Northern companies in equal parts served each coi-
pany as well as if it were the sole owner of such stock, while
such purchase might have been beyond the financial means of
either company by itself.
The Great Northern and Northern Pacific companies there-
fore each purchased an equal number of shares of the Burling-
tion stock as the best means and for the sole l)urpose of reaching
the best markets for the products of the territory along their
lines, and of securing connections which would furnish the
largest amount of traffic for their respective roads, increase the
trade and interchange of commodities between the regions trav-
ersed by the Burlington lines and their connections and the
regions traversed or reached by the Great Northern and North-
ern Pacific lines, and by their connecting lines of shipping on
