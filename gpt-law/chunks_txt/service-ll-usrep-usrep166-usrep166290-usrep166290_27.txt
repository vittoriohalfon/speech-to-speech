as between places and as steady as in the nature of things
was practicable."
That unstable rates between competing carriers lead to in-
jurious discrimination, one of the evils sought to be remedied
by the act, was mentioned in the same report at pages 36 and
37, in connection with a discussion of the subject of reason-
able charges, in the following language:
"Among the reasons most frequently operating to cause
complaints of rates may be mentioned: the want of steadiness
in rates. . . . More often, perhaps, growing out of disa-
greements between competing companies, which, when they
become serious, may result in wars of rates between them.
Wars of rates, when mutual injury is the chief purpose in
view, as is sometimes the case, are not only mischievous in
their immediate effects upon the parties to them, and upon
the business community whose calculations and plans must
for a time be disturbed, but they have a permanently injuri-
ous influence upon the railroad service because of their effect
upon the public mind."
The evil effects of shifting rates was also treated of at page
22 of the second annual report, where the commission inserted
a letter received from a business man of Kansas City, not
connected with railroads, who said:
"The frequent and violent changes in railway rates which
have taken place during the past few years, and which seem
likely to be unabated, seems to me to call for new legislation
in the way of amendment of the interstate commerce bill.
These changes are ruinous to all business men, as well as
the railways, and are the cause of great discontent among
shippers everywhere, and especially to the farmers. What is
needed is a fixed permanent rate, which shall be reasonable,
and which can be counted upon by any one engaging in
business."
So, also, in the fourth annual report it was observed
that shifting, unstable rates, by competing roads, was con-
trary to the purpose of the Interstate Commerce Act, and
hampered the operations of the commission. It was said at
page 21:

"In former reports the commission has referred to the un-
doubted fact that competition for business between tailroad
companies is often pushed to ruinous extremes, and the most
serious difficulty in the way of securing obedience to the law
may be traced to this fact. When competition degenerates
to rate wars, they are as unsettling to the business of the
country as they are mischievous to the carriers, and the spirit
of existing law is against them."
In addition to the text of the law heretofore commented on,
the section which forbids pooling adds cogency tb the con-
struction that the law could not have been intended to forbid
contracts between carriers for the purpose of preventing the
doing of those things which the law forbade. For, as I have
said, it cannot be denied that at the time of the passage of the
act there existed associations and contracts between carriers
for other purposes than the pooling of their earnings. Whilst
the exact scope of these contracts is not shown, the fact that
their existence was considered by Congress results from: the
face of the act, since it requires that agreements and contracts
between carriers shall be filed with the commission. More-
over, the earlier reports of the commission, as I have shown,
refer to such traffic agreements, and state that after the pas-
sage of the act they continued to exist as they had existed
before eliminating only the pooling feature.
In view of these facts, when the act expressly forbids con-
tracts and combinations between railroadsf or pooling, and
makes no mention of other contracts, it is clear that the con-
tinued existence of such contracts was contemplated, and they
are not intended to be forbidden by the act. The elementary
rule of expressio unius entirely justifies this implication.
And it is, I submit, no answer to this reasoning to say that
the record does not show the terms of these contracts, since
judicial notice may be taken of the reports made by the com-
mission to Congress, from which reports the nature of the con-
tracts is sufficiently pointed out to authorize the conclusion that
they were of the general character of the one here assailed.
Whilst the excerpts from the reports of the commission
which have been heretofore made, serve to elucidate the text

of the act, they also, I submit, constitute a contemporaneous
construction of the provisions of the act made by the officers
charged with its administration, which is entitled to very
great weight. Brown v. United States, 113 U. S. 568, 571,
and cases there cited.
The rule sustained by these authorities receives additional
sanction here, from the fact that the construction at the time
made by the commission was reported to Congress, and the
act was subsequently amended by that body without any
repudiation of such construction.
It is, I submit, therefore not to be denied that the agree-
ment between the carriers, the validity of which is here
drawn in question, seeking to secure uniform classification
and to prevent the undercutting of the published rates, even
though such agreements be made with competing as'w ell as
joint lines, is in accord with the plain text of the Interstate
Commerce Act, and is in harmony with the views of the pur-
poses of that law contemporaneously expressed to Congress
by the body immediately charged with its administration,
and tacitly approved by Congress.
But, departing from a consideration of the mere text and
looking at the Interstate Commerce Act from a broader as-
pect, in order to discover the intention of the lawmaker and
to discern the evils which it was intended to suppress and the
remedies which it was proposed to afford by its enactment, it
seems to me very clear that the contract in question is in accord
with the act and should not be avoided.
It cannot be questioned that the Interstate Commerce Act
was intended by Congress to inaugurate a new policy for the
purpose of reasonably controlling interstate commerce rates
and the dealings of carriers with reference to such rates.
Two systems were necessarily presented: the one a prohibi-
tion against the exaction of all unreasonable rates and sub-
ject to this restriction, allowing the hourly and daily play
of untrammelled competition, resulting in inequality and dis-
crimination; the other imposing a like duty as to reasonable
rates, and whilst allowing competition -subject to this limita-
tion, preventing the injurious consequences arising from a
