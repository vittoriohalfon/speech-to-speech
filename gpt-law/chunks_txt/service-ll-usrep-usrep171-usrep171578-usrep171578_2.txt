and Territories. These drafts are paid by the consignees and
the proceeds remitted to the various owners through the
banks.
The business thus conducted is alleged to be interstate com-
merce, and it is further alleged that- if the person to whom
the live stock is consigned at Kansas City is not a member of
the exchange, he is not permitted to and cannot sell or dis-
pose of the stock at the Kansas City market, for the reason
that the defendants, and all the other commission merchants,
members of the exchange, refuse to buy live stock or in any
manner negotiate or deal with or buy from a person or com-
mission merchant who is not a member of the exchange, and
thus the owner of live stock shipped to the Kansas City mar-
ket is compelled to re-ship the same to other markets, and by.
reason of the unlawful combination existing among the defend-
ants and the other members of the exchange the owner is
prevented from delivering this stock at the Kansas City stock
yards, and the sale of stock is thereby hindered and delayed,
entailing extra expense and loss to the shipper, and placing an
obstruction and embargo on the marketing of all live stock
shipped from the States and Territories to the Kansas City
market which is not consigned to the stock yards company or
to the defendants, or some of them, members of the stock ex-
change.
It is alleged that the defendants, as members of the ex-
change, have adopted certain rules, among them being rules
9 and 16, which are particularly alleged to be in restraint
of trade and commerce between the States, and intended to
create a monopoly, in contravention of the laws of the United
States in that behalf.
Rule 9 provides as follows:
"SEcrioN 1. Cbmmissions charged by members of this asso-
ciation for selling live stock shall not be less than the follow-
ing named rates."
Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 relate to the amounts of such
commissions, and it is alleged that in some instances the com-
missions are greater than had theretofore been paid.
Section 8 permits the members to handle the business of

non-resident commission firms when the stock is consigned
directly to or from such firm, at half the rates fixed by the
rule, provided the non-resident commission firms are estab-
lished at the markets named in the section.
Section 10 prohibits the employment of any agent, solicitor
or employ6 except upon a stipulated salary not contingent upon
the commissions earned, and it provides that not more than
three solicitors shall be employed at one time by a commis-
sion firm or corporation, resident or non-resident of Kansas
City.
Section 11 forbids any member of the exchange from send-
ing or causing to be sent a prepaid telegram or telephone
message quoting the markets or giving information as to the
condition of the same, under the penalty of a fine as therein
stated. The rule, however, permits prepaid messages to be
sent to shippers quoting actual sales of their stock on the date
made; also to parties desiring to make purchases on the
market.
Rule 16 provides, in section 1, "That no member of the ex-
change shall transact business with any persons violating any
of the rules or regulations of the exchange, or with an expelled
or suspended member after notice of such violation, suspen-
sion or expulsion shall have been issued by the secretary or
board of directors of the exchange."
It is alleged that the defendants in adopting these rules and
in forming the exchange and carrying out the same have
violated aid are violating the statute of the United States,
approved July 2, 1890, c. 64-7, 26 Stat. 209, entitled "An act
to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and
monopolies," and it is charged that it was the purpose of the
defendants, in organizing the exchange and in adopting the
rules mentioned, to prevent the shipment or consignment of
any live stock to the Kansas City market unless it was shipped
or consigned to the Kansas City stock yards and to some one
or other of the defendants, members of the exchange, and to
compel the shippers of live stock from other States and from
the Territories to pay to the defendants the commissions and
charges provided for in rule 9, and to prevent such shippers

from placing their property on sale at the Kansas City market
unless these commissions were paid.
The answer of the defendants admitted their forming the
exchange and becoming members thereof, and adopting, among
others, the rules specially mentioned in complainants' bill.
They denied that the exchange itself engaged in any business
whatever, and alleged that it existed simply in order to pre-
scribe rules and provide facilities for the transaction of busi-
ness by the members thereof, and to govern them by such
rules and regulations as have been evolved and sanctioned by
the developments of commerce, and which are universally
recognized to be just and fair to all concerned.
It was further set up in the answer that each member of the
organization was in fact left free to compete in every manner,
and by all means recognized to be .fair and just, for his share
of the business which comes to the point at which the mem-
bers of the organization do business; that in adopting their
rules they followed in all substantial respects the provisions
which had been made upon the same subject respectively by
the exchanges theretofore established at Chicago and East St.
Louis, Illinois, and which have been since established at St.
Louis, Omaha, Indianapolis, Buffalo, Sioux City and Fort
Worth; and that the exchange at no time refused to admit as a
member any reputable person who was willing to comply
with the conditions of membership and to abide by the rules
of the organization.
Various allegations in the bill as to the effect of the organi-
zation in precluding any sales or purchases of cattle other than
by its members are denied.
The defendants also deny that the exercise of their occupa-
tion as commission merchants, doing business as members of
the exchange, constitutes or amounts to interstate commerce,
within the meaning of the Constitution or laws of the United
States. They allege that they have no part in or control over
the disposition of the live stock sold by them to others, nor
of live stock purchased by them as commission merchants acting
for others. They allege that the stock yards company permits
any person whatsoever to transact business at its yards who
