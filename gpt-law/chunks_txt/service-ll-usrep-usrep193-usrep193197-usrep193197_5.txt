large majority of the capital stock of the defendant the North-
ern Pacific Railway Company, the exact amount being unknown
to complainant, upon the agreed basis of exchange of $115, par
value, of the capital stock of the said Northern Securities Com-
pany for each share of the capital stock of the Northern Pacific
Railway Company; and thereafter, in further pursuance of the
unlawful combination or conspiracy aforesaid, the defendant,
the Northern Securities Company, offered to the stockholders of
the defendant railway companies to issue and exchange its capi-
tal stock for the capital stock of such railway companies, upon
the basis of exchange aforesaid, no other consideration being
required. In further pursuance of the unlawful combination
or conspiracy aforesaid the defendant the Northern Securities
Company has acquired an additional amount of the stock of the
defendant railway companies, issuing in lieu thereof its own
stock upon the basis of exchange aforesaid, and is now holding,
as owner and proprietor, substantially all of the capital stock of
the Northern Pacific Railway Company and, as complainant
believes and charges, a majority of the capital stock of the
Great Northern Railway Company, but if not a majority, at
least a controlling interest therein, and is voting the same and
is collecting the dividends thereon, and in all respects is acting
as the owner thereof in the organization, management, and
operation of said railway companies, and in the receipt and
control of their earnings, and will continue to do so, unless
restrained by the order of this court. By reason whereof a
virtual consolidation under one ownership and source of con-
trol of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway
systems has been effected, a combination or conspiracy in re-
straint of the trade or commerce among the several States and
with foreign nations formerly carried on by the defendant rail-
way companies independently and in free competition one with
the other has been formed and is in operation, and the defend-
ants are thereby attempting to monopolize, and have mo-
nopolized, such interstate and foreign trade or commerce, to
the great and irreparable damage of the people of the United

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Bill in Equity. 193 U. S.
States, in derogation of their common rights, and in violation
of the act of Congress of July 2, 1890, entitled "An act to pro-
tect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and mo-
nopolies."
IX. If the defendant the Northern Securities Company has
not acquired a large majority of the capital stock of the defend-
ant the Great Northern Railway Company, it is because the
individual defendants named, and their associates in the com-
bination or conspiracy charged in this petition, or some of them,
since it became apparent that the legality of their corporate
device for the merger of the stock of competing railway coin-
panies, through the instrumentality of a central or hokling
corporation, would be assailed in the courts, have purposely
withheld, or caused to be withheld, a large amount of the capi-
tal stock of said railway company from transfer for the stock
of the Northern Securities Company, and have purposely dis-
couraged and prevented the transfer and exchange of such
stock for the stock of the Northern Securities Company, all for
the purpose of concealing the real scope and object of the
unlawful combination or conspiracy aforesaid, and of deceiving
and misleading the state and Federal authorities, and of fur-
nishing a ground for the defence that the Northern Securities
Company does not hold a clear majority of the stock of the
Great Northern Railway Company. The complainant avers
that such stock, so withheld or not transferred to the Northern
Securities Company, is now in the hands of some person or
persons (unknown to the complainant) friendly to and under
the influence of the individual defendants named and their
associates aforesaid, or some of them, and will either not be
voted, or be voted in harmony with the Great Northern stock
held by the Northern Securities Company, until the question
of the legality of this corporate device for merging compet-
ing railway lines shall be finally and judicially determined,
when such stock will either be turned over to the Northern
Securities Company or continue to be held and voted outside
said company but in harmony with the Great Northern

stock held and voted by it, as may at the time seem advis-
able.
X. In further pursuance of the unlawful combination or con-
spiracy aforesaid, the Northern Securities Company (subject, it
may be, to the condition stated in the next preceding para-
graph) is about to and will, unless restrained by the order of
this court, receive and acquire, and hereafter hold and control
as owner and proprietor, substantially all of the capital stock of
the defendant railway companies, issuing in lieu thereof its own
capital stock to the full extent of the authorized issue, of which,
upon the basis of exchange aforesaid, the former stockholders
of the Great Northern Railway Company have received or will
receive and hold about 55 per cent thereof, the balance going
to the former stockholders of the Northern Pacific Railway
Company.
XI. No consideration whatever has existed, or will exist, for
the transfer as aforesaid of the stock of the defendant railway
companies from their stockholders to the Northern Securities
Company, other than the issue of the stock of the Northern
Securities Company to them in exchange therefor, for the pur-
pose, after the manner, and upon the basis aforesaid.
The defendant, the Northern Securities Company, was not
organized in good faith to purchase and pay for the stocks of
the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific Railway com-
panies. It was organized solely to incorporate the pooling of
the stocks of said companies and to carry into effect the unlaw-
ful combination or conspiracy aforesaid. The Northern Securi-
ties Company is a mere depositary, custodian, holder, and
trustee of tle stocks of the Great Northern and the Northern
Pacific Railway companies, and its shares of stock are but
beneficial certificates issued against said railroad stocks to
designate the interest of the holders in the pool. The Northern
Securities Company does not have and never had any capital
sufficient to warrant such a stupendous operation. Its sub-
scribed capital was but $30,000, and its authorized capital
stock of $400,000,000 is just sufficient, when all issued, to
