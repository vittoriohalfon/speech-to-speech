companies, except with the approval of the managers. They
are also charged with the duty of securing to each company,
party to the agreement, equitable proportions of the competi-
tive traffic covered by the agreement, so far as can be legally
-done. The natural, direct and necessary effect of all these
various provisions of the agreement is to prevent any competi-
tion whatever between the parties to it for the whole time of
its existence. It is probably as effective in that way as would
be a provision in the agreement prohibiting in terms any com-
petition whatever.
It is also said .that the agreement in the first case conferred
upon the association an unlimited power to fix rates in the
first instance, and that the authority was not confined to
reasonable rates, while in the case now before us the agree-
ment starts out with rates fixed by each company for itself
and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and
which rates are alleged to be reasonable. The distinction is
unimportant. It was considered in the other case that the
rates actually fixed upon were reasonable, while the rates
fixed upon in this case are also admitted to. be reasonable.
By this agreement the board of managers is in substance and
as a result thereof placed in control of the business and rates
of transportation, and its duty is to see to it that each com-
pany charges the rates agreed upon and receives its equitable
proportion of the traffic.
The natural and direct effect of the two agreements is the
same, viz., to maintain rates at a higher level than would
otherwise prevail, and the differences between them are not
sufficiently important or material to call for different judg-
ments in the two cases on any such ground. Indeed, counsel
for one of the railroad companies on this argument, in speak-
ing of the agreement in the Tans-Miwsouri case, says of it
that its terms, while substantially similar 'to those of the
agreement here, were less explicit in making it just and
reasonable.
Regarding the two agreements as alike in their main and
material features, we are brought to an examination of the
question of the constitutionality of the act, construed as it has

been in the Trans-Missouri case. It is worthy of remark that
this question was never raised or hinted at upon the argument
of that case, although, if the respondents' present contention
be sound, it would have furnished a conclusive objection to
the enforcement of the act as construed. The fact that not
one of the many astute and able counsel for the transporta-
tion companies in that case raised an objection of so conclu-
sive a character, if well founded, is strong evidence that the
reasons showing the invalidity of the act as construed do
not lie on the surface and were not then apparent to those
counsel.
The point not being raised and the decision of that case
having proceeded upon an assumption of the validity of the act
under either construction, it can, of course, constitute no au-
thority upon this question. Upon the constitutionality of the
act it is now earnestly contended that contracts in restraint of
trade are not necessarily prejudicial to the security or welfare
of society, and that Congress is without power to prohibit
generally all contracts in restraint of trade; and the effort to
do this invalidates the act in question. It is urged that it is
for the court to decide whether the mere fact that a contract
or arrangement, whatever its purpose or character, may re-
strain trade in some degree, renders it injurious or prejudicial
to the welfare or security of society, and if the court be of
opinion that such welfare or security is not prejudiced by a.
contract of that kind, then Congress has no power to prohibit
it, and the act must be declared unconstitutional. It is claimed
that the act can be supported only as an exercise of the police
power, and that the constitutional guarantees furnished by the
Fifth Amendment secure to all persons freedom in the pursuit
of their vocations and the use of their property, and in making
such contracts or arrangements as may be necessary therefor.
In dwelling upon the far-reaching nature of the language used
in the act as construed in the case mentioned, counsel contend
that the extent to which it limits the freedom and destroys the
property of the individual can scarcely be exaggerated, and
that ordinary contracts and combinations, which are at the
same time most indispensable, have the effect of somewhat-

restraining trade and commerce, although to a very slight ex-
tent, but yet, under the construction adopted, they are illegal.
As examples of the kinds of contracts which are rendered
illegal by this construction of the act, the learned counsel
suggest all organizations of mechanics engaged in the same
business for the purpose of limiting the number of persons
employed in the business, or of maintaining wages ; the forma-
tion of a corporation to carry on any particular line of business
by those already engaged therein; a contract of partnership
or of employment between two persons previously engaged
in the same line of business; the appointment by two pro-
ducers of tie same person to sell their goods on commission;
the purchase by one wholesale merchant of the product of two
producers; the lease or purchase by a farmer, manufacturer or
merchant of an additional farm, manufactory or shop; the
withdrawal from business of any farmer, m erchant or manu-
facturer; a sale of the good will of a business with an agree-
ment not to destroy its value by engaging in similar business;
and a covenant in a deed restricting the use of real estate.
It is added that the effect of most business contracts or com-
binations is to restrain trade in some degree.
This makes quite a formidable list. It will be observed,
however, that no contract of the nature above described is
now before the court, and there is some embarrassment in
assuming to decide herein just how far the act goes in the
direction claimed. Nevertheless, we might say that the forma-
tion of corporations for business or manufacturing purposes
has never, to our knowledge, been regarded in the nature of
a contract in restraint of trade or commerce. The same may
be said of the contract of partnership. It might also be diffi-
cult to show that the appointment by two or more producers
of the same person to sell their goods on commission was a
matter in any degree in restraint of trade.
We are not aware that it has ever been claimed that a lease
or purchase by a farmer, manufacturer or merchant of an
additional farm, manufactory or shop, or the withdrawal from
business of any farmer, merchant or manufacturer, restrained
commerce or trade within any legal definition of that term;
