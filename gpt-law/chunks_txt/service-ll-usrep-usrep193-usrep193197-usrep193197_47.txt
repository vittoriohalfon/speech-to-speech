by the Constitution. It does contend that no state corpora-
tion can stand in the way of the enforcement of the national
will, legally expressed. What the Government particularly
complains of, indeed, all that it complains of here, is the ex-
istence of a combination among the stockholders of competing
railroad companies which in violation of the act of Congress
restrains interstate and international commerce through the
agency of a common corporate trustee designated to act for
both companies in repressing free competition between them.
Independently of any question of the mere ownership of stock
or of the organization of a state corporation, can it in reason
be said that such a combination is not embraced by the very
terms of the Anti-Trust Act? May not Congress declare that
combination to be illegal? If Congress legislates for the pro-
tection of the public, may it not proceed on the ground that
wrongs when effected by a powerful combination are more
dangerous and require more stringent supervision than when
they are to be effected by a single person? Callan v. Wilson,
127 U. S. 540, 556. How far may the courts go in order to
give effect to the act of Congress, and remedy the evils it was
designed by that act to suppress? These are confessedly ques-
tions of great moment, and they will now be considered.
By the express words of the Constitution, Congress has power
to "regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the
several States, and with the Indian tribes." In view of the
numerous decisions of this court there ought not, at this day,
to be any doubt as to the general scope of such power. In some
circumstances regulation may properly take the form and have
the effect of prohibition. In re Ralhrer, 140 U. S.5 45; Lottery
Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355, and authorities there cited. Again
and again this court has reaffirmed the doctrine announced in
the great judgment rendered by Chief Justice Marshall for the
court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196, 197, that the power
of Congress to regulate commerce among the States and with
foreign nations is the power "to prescribe the rule by which
commerce is to be governed;" that such power "is complete

in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowl-
edges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitu-
tion;" that "if, as has always been understood, the sovereignty
of Congress, though limited to specified objects, is plenary as
to those objects, the power over commerce with foreign na-
tions and among the several States, is vested in Congress as
absolutely as it would be in a single government haing in its
consitu tion the same restrictions on the exercise of the power as
are found in the Constitution of the United States;" that a
sound construction of the Constitution allows to Congress a
large discretion, "with respect to the means by which the
powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which en-
able that body to perform the high duties assigned to it, in the
manner most beneficial to the people;" and that if the end to
be accomplished is within the scope of the Constitution, "all
means which are appropriate, which are plainly adaptcd to
that end and which are not prohibited, are constitutional."

Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 413, this court said that, the
United States were for many important purposes "a single
nation," and that "in all commercial regulations we are one
and the same people;" and it has since frequently declared
that commerce among the several States was a unit, and sub-
ject to national control. Previously, in McCulloch v. Mary-
land, 4 Wheat. 316, 405, the court had said that the Govern-
ment ordained and established by the Constitution w'as, within
the limits of the powers granted to it, "the Government of all;
its powers are delegated by all; it represents all, and acts for
all," and waqs "supreme within its sphere of action." As late
as the case of In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 582, this court, every
member of it concurring, said: "The entire strength of the
Nation may be used to enforce in any part of the land the

full and free exercise of all National powers and the security
of all rights entrusted by the Constitution to its care. The
strong arm of the National Government may be put forth to
brush away all obstructions to the freedom of interstate com-
merce or the transportation of the mails. If the emergency
arises, the army of the Nation, and all its militia, are at the
service of the Nation to compel obedience to its laws."
The means employed in respect of the combinations forbidden
by the Anti-Trust Act, and which Congress deemed germane
to the end to be accomplished, was to prescribe as a rule for in-
terstate and international commerce, (not for domestic com-
merce,) that it should not be vexed by combinations, conspir-
acies or monopolies which restrain commerce by destroying or
restricting competition. We say that Congress has prescribed
such a rule, because in all the prior cases in this court the Anti-
Trust Act has been construed as forbidding any combination
which by its necessary operation destroys or restricts free com-
petition among those engaged in interstate commerce; in other
words, that to destroy or restrict free competition in interstate
commerce was to restrain such commerce. Now, can this court
say that such a rule is prohibited by the Constitution or is not
one that Congress could appropriately prescribe when exert-
ing its power under the commerce clause of the Constitution?
Whether the free operation of the normal laws of competition
is a wise and wholesome rule for trade and commerce is an
economic question which this court need not consider or de-
termine. Undoubtedly, there are those who think that the
general business interests and prosperity of the country will
be best promoted if the rule of competition is not applied. But
there are others who believe that such a rule is more necessary
in these days of enormous wealth than it ever was in any
former period of our history. Be all this as it may, Congress
has, in effect, recognized the rule of free competition by de-
claring illegal every combination or conspiracy in restraint of
interstate and international commerce. As in the judgment
of Congress the public convenience and the general welfare
