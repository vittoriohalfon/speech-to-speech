Defendants insist that it is immaterial that a combination
can be discovered by going behind the fiction that the Se-
curities Company is a private person with an existence sep-
arate and apart from its members, because, as they say, the
law will not allow that fiction to be disregarded or contra-
dicted-will not allow the acts of the corporate entity to be
treated as the acts of the natural persons who compose it.
The defendants thus seek to defeat the ends of the law by a
fiction invented to promote them. This proposition cannot
be sustained. People v. North River Sugar Rfg. Co., 121 N. Y.
582, 615.
It can never be a question as to whether parties to a com-
bination in restraint of trade are individuals or corporations;
it is always a question as to the nature, effect, and operation
of the combination.
Of course a State has certain powers over the instrumen-
talities of commerce which it creates, as it has over the indi-
viduals by whom commerce is conducted. But a State has no
power over either instrumentalities or individuals that can be
interposed between them and the obligations imposed by a
Federal statute regulating interstate commerce.
Where the subject is national in its character the Federal
power is exclusive of the state power. Welton v. Missouri,
91 U. S. 280.
Congress has power to regulate commerce among the
States, and when in the exercise of that power it becomes
necessary to legislate respecting the instrumentalities of com-
merce, it may do so, irrespective of the question as to how or
by what authority those instrumentalities were created.
And if regulation of the control of these instrumentalities
is essential to prevent the subversion of a policy of Congress
it may regulate that control.

Argument of Attorney General for United States. 193 U. S.
The power to regulate commerce among the several States
includes the power to prevent restraint upon such commerce.
To restrain commerce is to regulate it.
Therefore any law of any State which restrains interstate
commerce is invalid; and any contract between individuals or
'corporations, or any combination in any form which restrains
such commerce is invalid.
The supreme power extends to the whole subject. Under
this plenary power Congress has supervised interstate com-
merce from the granting of franchises to engage therein, to
the most minute directions as to its operation. For this pur-
pose it possesses all powers which existed in the States be-
fore the adoption of the National Constitution, and which have
always existed in the Parliament of England. In re Dcbs,
158 U. S. 586; Gilman. v. Philadelphia,3 Wall. 725.
If the arrangement accomplishes that which the law pro-
hibits, through the means which the law prohibits, it is cer-
tainly within the prohibition of the law, and if this were a
consolidation under state athority instead of being a com-
bination which effects that which defies the law of every foot of
land which these railroads occupy, there should be no hesita-
tion in saying that it violated the Federal statute, if it accom-
plished a restraint upon interstate commerce. To hold other-
wise would be to read into the law a proviso to the effect that
the act should not apply when the combination took the form
of a railroad consolidation under authority of state legislation.
Fictions of law, invented to promote justice, can never be
invoked to accomplish its defeat. "In fictione juris semp er
wquitas existit." Mostyn v. Fabriges, Cowper, 177; Morris v.
Pugh, 3 Burr. 1243; Morawetz, §§ 1, 227; Taylor on Corpora-
tions, § 50; Clark and Marshall on Private Corporations, 17, 22;
State v. Standard Oil Co., 49 Ohio St. 137; Ford v. M1ilk Ship-
pers, supra, and other cases cited supra.
The Northern Securities Company, in violation of section 2
of the Anti-Trust Act, has monopolized a part of interstate
commerce by acquiring a large majority of the shares of the

capital stock of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific
Railway companies-two parallel and competing lines engaged
in interstate commerce; and the Northern Securities Company
and the individual defendants, or two or more of them, have
combined, each with the other, so to monopolize a part of
interstate commerce.
From the facts and the argument already made it appears
that by acquiring a majority of the shares of the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific the Securities Company has obtained
the control of, and, therefore, the power to suppress competi-
tion between, two rival and competing lines of railway engaged
in interstate commerce, and in that way has monopolized a
part of interstate commerce. This conclusion is sustained
by the judgment of this court in the case of Pearsall v. Great
Northern Railway, supra, which is conclusive of the case at
bar, since it establishes the principle that to vest, designedly,
in one person or set of persons, a majority of stock of two
competing lines of interstate railway is to monopolize a part
of interstate railroad traffic.
Even if a natural person could lawfully have done what the
Securities Company has done, that would be no argument to
prove that the Securities Company, in so doing, has not vio-
lated the law against monopolies. People v. North River Sugar
Refining Company, supra, p. 625.
It is not denied that the very spirited contention that the
construction the Government puts upon the law in question in-
terferes with the power of people to do what they will with
their property.
That was the very object of the law, and it was certainly
contemplated that the rights of purchase, sale, and contract
would be controlled, so far as necessary, to prevent those
rights from being exercised to defeat the law.
A combination cannot be imagined coming into existence
without more or less redistribution of property between indi-
viduals through purchases, sales, or contracts. Combinations
are never bestowed upon us ready made.
