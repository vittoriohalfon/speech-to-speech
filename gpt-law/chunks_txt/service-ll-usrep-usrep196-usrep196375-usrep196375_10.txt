OCTOBER TERMI, 1904.
Opinion of the Court. 106 U. S.
elements, if entered into with the intent to monopolize, as
alleged, is a more delicate question. The question is how it
would stand if the tenth section were the whole bill. Not
every act that may be done with intent to produce an unlawful
result is unlawful, or constitutes an attempt. It is a question
of proximity and degree. The distinction between mere prepa-
ration and attempt is well known in the criminal law Com-
monwealth v Peaslee, 177 Massachusetts, 267, 272. The same
distinction is recognized in cases like the present. United
States v E. C Knight Co., 156 U S. 1, 13, Kidd v Pearson,
128 U S. 1, 23, 24. We are of opinion, however, that such a
combination is within the meaning of the statute. It is ob-
vious that no more powerful instrument of monopoly could
be used than an advantage in the cost of transportation. And
even if the advantage is one which the act of 1887 permits,
which is denied, perhaps inadequately, by the adjective "un-
lawful," still a combination to use it for the purpose prohibited
by the act of 1890 justifies the adjective and takes the per-
mission away
It only remains to add that the foregoing question does not
apply to the earlier sections, which charge direct restraints of
trade within the decisions of the court., and that the criticism
of the decree, as if it ran generally against combinations in
restraint of trade or to monopolize trade, ceases to have any
force when the clause against "any other method or device"
is stricken out. So modified it restrains such combinations
only to the extent of certain specified devices, which the de-
fendants are alleged to have used and intend to continue to
use.
Decree modified and affirmed.
