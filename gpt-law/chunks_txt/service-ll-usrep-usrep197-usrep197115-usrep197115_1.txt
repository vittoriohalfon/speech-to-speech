NATIONAL COTTON OIL COMPANY ,. TEXAS.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF CIVIL APPEALS IN AN!) FOR THE THIRD
SUPREME JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF TIlE STATE OF TEXAS.
No. 37. Argled November 1,2, 1904.-Decided February 27, 1905.
The Anti-Trust Acts of Texas of 1889, 1895 and 1899, are all directed to the
prohibitions of combinations to restrict trade, to in any way limit com-
petition in the production or sale of articles, or to increase or reduce
prices in order to preclude free and unrestricted competition; and, as the
legislature of a State may ordain that competition and not combination
shall be the law of trade, and may prohibit combinations to control
prices, the statutes as they now stand are not in conflict with the Four
teenth Amendment and do not, as against corporations dealing in cotton
oil and combining to regulate the price of cotton seed, work a deprivation
of property without due process of law, or impair theiir liberty of contract.
The idea of monopoly is not now confined to a grant of privileges but is
understood to include a condition produced by the acts of individuals
and the suppression of competition by unification of interest or manage-
ment or through agreement and concert of action. It is the power to
control prices which makes both the inducement to Inake such com-
binations and the concern of the law to prohibit them.
The Supreme Court of Texas having construed the act of 1895 as invalid,
so far as it was discriminatory by excepting from its operation combina-
tions of agriculturists and organi:ed laborers and fell within the terms
of Conolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 II. S. 540, and sustained the
act in other respects, and having also held that the act of 1899 although
cumulative did not continue the invalid discriminatory provisions of the

act of 1895, this court follows the state court in holding that under the
laws of Texas, as they now exist, combinations described in the Anti-
Trust Laws are forbidden and penalized whether by agriculturists, organ-
ized laborers or others, and there is therefore no discrimination against
oil companies, and the latter are not deprived of the equal protection
of the laws.
THIS suit was brought under the Anti-Trust Acts of the
State of Texas, to forfeit the license of the National Cotton
Oil Company to do business in the State of Texas, for violating
those acts. The defense is that the acts are repugnant to the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States.
The suit was instituted by the Attorney General of the State
and the District Attorney of the Twenty-sixth Judicial Dis-
trict, and the petition alleged the following facts: The National
Cotton Oil Company and the Southern Cotton Oil Company are
New Jersey corporations, doing and transacting business in
the State of Texas by reason of a permit issued to them re-
spectively on the second day of May, 1900, and the third day
of June, 1897.
The Taylor Cotton Oil Works is a Texas corporation, doing
business in the State under a charter granted August 25, 1898.
The said foreign corporations, from the date of their respective
permits and the Taylor Cotton Oil Works from the date of its
charter have been and are. "engaged in the business of the
manufacture and sale of cotton seed oil, cotton seed meal and
the other by-products of cotton seed; that the business in
which each and all of such corporations were engaged neces-
sitated the .purchase of cotton seed from Which the products
which they manufactured and sold were made, and that said
cotton seed was an article and commodity of merchandise:"
Each of them on or about the first of November, 1901, and
on every day prior and subsequent thereto, has been engage d
iI the business of buying cotton seed in the various counties
of the State, and on the first of November, 1901, the National
Cotton Oil Company made and entered into a combination
with each of the other companies and they with it, and each

of them with various other persons, firms and corporations,
whose names are to the defendant in error unknown, and the
said corporations "became members of and parties to a pool,
trust, agreement, confederation and understanding with each
of the other of said corporations,. firms and persons, whereby
they did each for itself and with each other and all together
agree to regulate and fix, and did. regulate and fix, the price
at which-they would buy cotton seed; that they especially
regulated and fixed the price of cotton seed throughout the
State of Texas at $14.00 per ton, and agreed amongst and
with each other that they would not give more,'than said
$14.00 per ton for cotton seed in any of the towns and com-
munities of the State of Texas." Whereby, "and by main-
taining the agreement to regulate and fix the price of cotton
seed aforesaid, the-defendant (the National Cotton Oil Com-
pany) was guilty of a violation of the laws of the State of
Texas," and in consequence has forfeited its permit to transact
business in the State. The cancellation and forfeiture of the
permit was prayed, and that the oil company be enjoined
from transacting business in the State.
A demurrer was filed to the petition for insufficiency in
law to entitle the State to any relief, and alleged against
each of the Anti-Trust Acts of the State and the provisions of
the Penal Code based thereon, that they violated section 1,
Art. XIV, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the
United States, in that the act of March 30, 1889, and the code
provisions based thereon, deprived the company of the equal
protection of the laws, because it was provided by section thir-
teen of said act and article 988 of the Penal Code that the said
statutes "shall not apply to agricultural products or live stock
while in the hands of the producer or raiser." And that the
act of April 30, 1895, and certain sections of the Revised Stat-
utes of Texas and of the Penal Code were likewise discrimina-
tory because of the same exceptions, and the further exception
that said statutes should not be held to "be understood or
construed to prevent the organization of laborers for the
