guments below in its support, and of the decision of the lower
court was the assertion of a conspiracy which never existed.
It is conceded that the Securities Company did acquire a ma-
jority of stock of both railroad companies and such acquisition
was because of its intent to acquire. The company is charge-
able with all the legal consequences of an intentional acquisi-
tion of such shares. It is denied, however, that any indi-
viduals or corporations conspired to do anything except to
form a corporation and acquire shares of the Northern Pacific
Railway Company belonging to them, and about twenty-seven
per cent of the stock of the Great Northern Railway Company.
The subsequent acquisition of an additional fifty per cent of
the Great Northern stock was for third persons over whom the
defendants had no control but who simply accepted an invita-
tion to sell their stock issued by the Securities Company after
its formation. The authorized capital of that company was
made sufficiently large to enable it to acquire all the stock of
both roads but this was not in pursuance of any combination,
conspiracy or contract but of the policy of the appellants to let
every co-shareholder of the railroad companies have the bene-
fit of every advantage obtained for themselves.
Everything of which the Government complains was done
with the intention of working out with permanent results the
problem of interstate and international commerce. In order
to effect permanent arrangements and to promote a great pub-
lic end through a greatly increased commerce, at low rates, the
two railway companies purchased the shares of the Burling-
ton road for over $200,000,000, paid by their joint and sev-
eral bonds, thus being able to give assurances of permanency
of low rates and do such other things as were necessary in
building up and enlarging this great commerce. This resulted
in demands by the Union Pacific for a part of the traffic
and on their being refused the Oregon Short Line acting for
the Union Pacific acquired a large amount, almost a control-
ling interest, in the stock of the Northern Pacific. The situa-
tion was critical and the organization of the Securities Coin-

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Argument of Mr. Johnson for Northern Securities Co. 193 U. S.
pany and all that followed was for the purpose of preventing
a raid on the stock similar to that which had so nearly suc-
ceeded and was done solely with the attempt to secure the
maintenance of the benefit to commerce, which had resulted,
and which, still more in the future, would result from the ac-
quisition of the Burlington shares.
Such alliances as that of the Burlington with the Northern
Pacific and Great Northern are valuable because they give an
opportunity of securing a large number of markets in a great,
and rich territory under a fairly permanent transportation
policy. They are of enormous value to the people along the
lines of the railroads, to the country generally and to the world.
To transact business, large investments must be made and the
condition prerequisite thereto is reasonable assurance of con-
tinuance. When the Government seeks to condemn an ar-
rangement which promotes the interest of the whole nation by
pretending that it was intended to restrain trade, it must es-
tablish convincingly the existence of the illegal intent alleged.
The sole question of law to be determined is whether or not
the acquisition by a corporation of a controlling interest in the
shares of two competitive railway companies, violates the
Sherman Act. It is not illegal for an existing corporation to
acquire such controlling interest; it is not illegal for persons
holding a sufficient number of shares to enter into an agree-
ment that will form a company to acquire such control. An
agreement to do what is legal cannot be an illegal conspiracy,
combination or contract.
The Sherman Act is a penal one, defining a criminal offense,
for which it provides a punishment. It is an indispensable
prerequisite to a conviction for a criminal misdemeanor, es-
pecially if there be no criminal intent, and such does not exist in
the present case, that the offense condemned shall be clearly de-
fined, and it is well settled that penal laws are to be strictly
construed. United States v. IlWillberger, 5 Wheat. 76; United
States v. Whittier, 5 Dillon, 35, citing United States v. Morris,

This court will not legislate but will merely discharge its duty
of construction. If the legislation is incomplete a crime can-
not be fastened upon one who has done innocently something
not defined as criminal. An act not made criminal cannot be
condemned because it may seem equally, or even more, evil
than the one made criminal. That Congress had no clearly
defined understanding of the nature of the misdemeanor at
which it struck, is evidenced by the final debates in the House
of Representatives.
The purchase by a person or corporation, of a majority of
the shares of two competing railway companies, is not "a con-
tract, combination in the form of a trust or otherwise, or con-
spiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several
States." The Sherman Act prohibits, not a contract tending
to restrain trade, but one actually in restraint thereof. The
meaning of "restraint of trade" was well understood when the
Sherman Act was passed. United States v. Freight Associa-
tion, 166 U. S. 290, 328. In the Addyston Case, 175 U. S.
211, the contract was actually in restraint of trade.
The holding by a person or corporation as owner of a ma-
jority of the shares of two competing railway companies,
is not "a contract or combination or conspiracy in restraint
of trade" within the meaning of the act.
A corporation, though incorporated for the purpose of hold-
ing, and actually holding, a majority of the shares of two
competing railway companies is not such a combination or
conspiracy. See the PearsallC ase, 161 U. S. 646; United'States
