NORTHERN SECURITIES CO. v. UNITED STATES. 317
193 U. S. HARLAN, J., Affirming Decree.
There is no defect of parties; all interests materially affected
by the decree of the Circuit Court are represented by the par-
ties before the court.
There were 1,300 persons who exchanged stock of the rail-
way companies for stock of the Securities Company, and in a
court of equity the interests of absent parties are represented
when there are parties having similar interests before the court.
Smith v. Swornstedt, 16 How. 288, 302.
Any question as to a defect of parties which might have
existed has been removed from the case by the form of the
decree entered by the Circuit Court, which simply adjudges
that the parties defendant have entered into an unlawful com-
bination and conspiracy in restraint of interstate commerce,
and then proceeds to enjoin the defendants, the Securities
Company, and the railway companies from doing the things
which alone give life and force to the combination. Tme
decree thus operates only on the parties to the bill and materi-
ally affects only their interests. The defendant corporations
stand for the interests of their respective stockholders. Sanger

sota v. Northern Securities Co., 184 U. S. 199.

cree of the Circuit Court, and delivered the following opinion:
This suit was brought by the United States against the
Northern Securities Company, a corporation of New Jer-
sey; the Great Northern Railway Company, a corporation of
Minnesota; the Northern Pacific Railway Company, a cor-
poration of Wisconsin; James J. Hill, a citizen of Minnesota;
and William P. Clough, D. Willis James, John S. Kennedy,
J. Pierpont Morgan, Robert Bacon, George F. Baker and

and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies."
26 Stat. 209. By the decree below the United States was
given substantially the relief asked by it in the bill.
As the act is not very long, and as the determination of the
particular questions arising in this case may require a consid-
eration of the scope and meaning of most of its provisions, it
is here given in full:
" SEC. 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby
declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any such
contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy,
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction
thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand
dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both
said punishments, in the discretion of the court.
"SEc. 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce
among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof,
shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars,
or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said
punishments, in the discretion of the court.
" SEC. 3. Every contract, combination in form of trust or
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or connerce in
any Territory of the United States or of the District of Co-
lumbia, or in restraint of trade or commerce between any
such Territory and another, or between any such Territory or
Territories and any State or States or the District of Columi-
bia, or with foreign nations, or between the District of Co-
lumbia and any State or States or foreign nations, is hereby
declared illegal. Every person who shall make any such con-
tract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall

or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said
punishments, in the discretion of the court.
" SEC. 4. The several Circuit Courts of the United States are
hereby invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain vio-
lations of this act; and it shall be the duty of the several dis-
trict attorneys of the United States, in their respective districts,
under the direction of the Attorney-General, to institute pro-
ceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations.
Such proceedings may be by way of petition setting forth the
case and praying that such violation shall be enjoined or other-
wise prohibited. When the parties complained of shall have
been duly notified of such petition the court shall proceed, as
soon as may be, to the hearing and determination of the case;
and, pending such petition and before final decree, the court
may at any time make such temporary restraining order or
prohibition as shall be deemed just in the premises.
" SE.5. Whenever it shall appear to the court before which
any proceeding under section four of this act may be pending,
that the ends of justice require that other parties should be
brought before the court, the court may cause them to be sum-
moned, whether they reside in the district in which the court
is held or not; and subpoenas to that end may be served in
any district by the marshal thereof.
" SEc. 6. Any property owned under any contract or by any
combination, or pursuant to any conspiracy (and being the
subject thereof) mentioned in section one of this act, and
being in the course of transportation from one State to an-
other, or to a foreign country, shall be forfeited to the United
States, and may be seized and condemned by like proceedings
as those provided by law for the forfeiture, seizure, and con-
demnation of property imported into the United States con-
trary to law.
" Sc. 7. Any person who shall be injured in his business or
property by any other person or corporation by reason of any-
thing forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act, may sue
therefor in any Circuit Court of the United States in the dis-
