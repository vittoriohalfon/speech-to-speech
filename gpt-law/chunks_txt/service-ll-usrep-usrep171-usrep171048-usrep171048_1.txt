operating lines in the city of Detroit, and is the successor in
interest of a similar corporation named the Detroit City Rail-
way. The rights asserted by it arise from. an ordinance of the
common council of that city passed upon November 24, 1862.
This provided that the Detroit City Railway was "exclusively
authorized to construct and operate railways as herein pro-
vided, on and through" (certain specified streets) "and through
such other streets and' avenues in said city as. may from time

cil of The said' city of Detroit and assented to in writing by
said corporation. . . . And provided the corporation does
not assent in writing, within thirty days after the passage of
said resolution of the council ordering the formation of new
routes, then the common council may give the privilege to
any other companr to build sucli route."
The ordinance provided also that "the powers and privi-
leges conferred by the provisions of- this ordinance shall be
limited to thirty years from and after the date of its passage."

Opinion of the Court.
ments thereto, are hereby extended and limited to thirty years
from this date."
On November 20, 1894-, the common council passed an
ordinance granting to several third parties the right to con-
struct street railways upon portions of certain streets upbn
which the plaintiff in error was maintaining and operating
street railways, and also the right to construct, maintain and
operate railways on certain other streets, alleys and public
places in the city of Detroit, without giving to plaintiff in
error the opportunity to decide whether it would construct
the same. The present suit was brought in the circuit court
for the county of Wayne and State of lichigan, to enjoin the
grantees named in the latter ordinance, and also the city,
from acting thereunder, upon the ground that it impaired the
contract between the city and the plaintiff in error arising
from the ordinances first aforesaid. The bill was dismissed,
and, on appeal to the*Supreme Court of the State, the decree
of dismissal was affirmed. From that decree the present writ
of error has been duly prosecuted to this court.
-There are five assignments of error. They present the con-
tention that the grant to the plaintiff in error was a contract
within the protection' of the provision of the Constitution of
the United States, which prohibits any State from passing any
law impairing the obligation of a contract, and that the sub-
sequent grant to the defendant in error, the Detroit :Railway,
was a violation and an impairment of the obligation of that
contract.

erie A. Baker for 'plaintiff in error: Mr. il ic/ael Brennan,
