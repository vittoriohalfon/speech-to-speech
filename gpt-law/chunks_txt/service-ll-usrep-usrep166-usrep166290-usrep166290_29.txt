OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Dissenting Opinion: White, Field, Gray, Shiras, JJ.
opinion (p. 406) that the contract there considered "was an,
agreement for the abandonment by one of the companies of
the discharge of its duties to the public." It is also to be
remembered that it was this character of contract, that is, one
which was ultra vires, which was held to be illegal in the
West Virginia, Illinois and Georgia cases, which were cited in
the Gibbs case in support of the excerpt just quoted. That
the language in the Gibbs ease referred to conditions of fact
like that there passed upon, that is, contracts ultra vires, is
shown by the subsequent case of Chicago &c. Railway Co. v.
Pullman Car Co., 139 U. S. 79, where a contract of the rail-
way company was assailed as in restraint of trade, and the
court held that although by the contract the company had
restrained itself for a long period of years from using other
than certain drawing room and sleeping cars, the contract was
yet a valid and proper contract. Manifestly, this decision is
utterly irreconcilable with the view that in the case of a rail-
road company, every restraint imposed by contract upon its
freedom of action is necessarily injurious to the public inter-
ests, and hence invalid. Indeed, the proposition that any
restraint of its conduct which a railroad may create by con-
tract is invalid, because such road is a public corporation, is
demonstrated to be erroneous by the Interstate Commerce Act,
which, in the provisions heretofore referred to, not only ex-
pressly authorizes, but in some instances, commands agree-
ments from which restraint of the action of the corporation
necessarily arises.
I am authorized to say that MR.J UsTicE FIELD, MR.J USTICE,
GRAY, and MR. JUSTICE SHIRAS concur in this dissent.
