State of New Jersey, or of any other State, Territory or coun-
try. 2. To purchase, hold, sell, assign, transfer, mortgage,
pledge or otherwise dispose of any bonds or other securities
or evidences of indebtedness created or issued by any other
corporation or corporations, association or associations, of the
State of New Jersey, or of any other State, Territory or coun-
try, and while owner thereof to exercise all the rights, powers

of any other State, Territory or country, and while owner of
such stock to exercise all the rights, powers and privileges
of ownership, including the right to vote thereon. 4. To aid
in any manner any corporation or association of which any
bonds or other securities or evidences of indebtedness or stock
are held by the corporation, and to do any acts or things de-
signed to protect, preserve, improve or enhance the value of
any such bonds or other securities or evidences of indebtedness
or stock. 5. To acquire, own and hold such real and personal
property as may be necessary or convenient for the transaction
of its business."
It was declared in the certificate that the business or pur-
pose of the corporation was from time to time to do any one
or more of such acts and things, and that the corporation
should have power to conduct its business in other States and
in foreign countries, and to have one or more offices, and hold,
purchase, mortgage and convey real and personal property,
out of New Jersey.
The total authorized capital stock of the corporation was
fixed at $400,000,000, divided into 4,000,000 shares of the par
value of $100 each. The amount of the capital stock with
which the corporation should commence business was fixed at
$30,000. The duration of the corporation was to be perpetual.
This charter having been obtained, Hill and his associate
stockholders of the Great Northern Railway Company, and

HARLAN, J., Affirming Decree. 193 U S
Morgan and associate stockholders of the Northern Pacific
Railway Company, assigned to the Securities Company a con-
trolling amount of the capital stock of the respective con-
stituent companies upon an agreed basis of exchange of the
capital stock of the Securities Company for each share of
the capital stock of the other companies.
In further pursuance of the combination, the Securities Com-
pany acquired additional stock of the defendant railway com-
panies, issuing in lieu thereof its own stock upon the above
basis, and, at the time of the bringing of this suit, held, as
owner and proprietor, substantially all the capital stock of the
Northern Pacific Railway Company, and, it is alleged, a con-
trolling interest in the stock of the Great Northern Railway
Company, "and is voting the same and is collecting the divi-
dends thereon, and in all respects is acting as the owner
thereof, in the organization, management and operation of
said railway companies and in the receipt and control of
their earnings."
No consideration whatever, the bill alleges, has existed or
will exist, for the transfer of the stock of the defendant rail-
way companies to the Northern Securities Company, other
than the issue of the stock of the latter company for the pur-
pose, after the manner, and upon the basis stated.
The Securities Company, the bill also alleges, was not or-
ganized in good faith to purchase and pay for the stocks of
the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies,
but solely "to incorporate the pooling of the stocks of said
companies," and carry into effect the above combination;
that it is a mere depositary, custodian, holder or trustee of the
stocks of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway
companies; that its shares of stock are but beneficial certifi-
cates against said railroad stocks to designate the interest of
the holders in the pool; that it does not have and never had
any capital to warrant such an operation; that its subscribed
capital was but $30,000, and its authorized capital stock of
$400,000,000 was just sufficient, when all issued, to represent

and cover the exchange value of substantially the entire stock
of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway com-
panies, upon the basis and at the rate agreed upon, which was
about $122,000,000 in excess of the combined capital stock of
the two railway companies taken at par; and that, unless pre-
vented, the Securities Company would acquire as owner and
proprietor substantially all the capital stock of the Great
Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, issuing
in lieu thereof its own capital stock to the full extent of its
authorized issue, of which, upon the agreed basis of exchange,
the former stockholders of the Great Northern Railway Com-
pany have received or would receive and hold about fifty-five
per cent, the balance going to the former stockholders of the
Northern Pacific Railway Company.
The Government charges that if the combination was held
not to be in violation of the act of Congress, then all efforts of
the National Government to preserve to the people the bene-
fits of free competition among carriers engaged in interstate
commerce will be wholly unavailing, and all transcontinental
lines, indeed the entire railway systems of the country, may
be absorbed, merged and consolidated, thus placing the public
at the absolute mercy of the holding corporation.
The several defendants denied all the allegations of the bill
imputing to them a purpose to evade the provisions of the act
of Congress, or to form a combination or conspiracy having
for its object either to restrain or to monopolize commerce or
trade among the States or with foreign nations. They denied
that any combination or conspiracy was formed in violation
of the act.
In our judgment, the evidence fully sustains the material
allegations of the bill, and shows a violation of the act of Con-
gress, in so far as it declares illegal every combination or con-
spiracy in restraint of commerce among the several States and
with foreign nations, and forbids attempts to monopolize such
commerce or any part of it.
Summarizing the principal facts, it is indisputable upon this
