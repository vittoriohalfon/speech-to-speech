Mr. C. K. Bell, Attorney General for the State of Texas,
for defendant in error in this case and in No. 38:
It has been held by the Supreme Court of the State of Texas
that the laws of 1889 and 1895 were valid and constitutional
enactments. But after Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co.,
184 U. S. 540, the decisions theretofore rendered by the ap-
pellate courts of Texas, upholding the laws mentioned so far
as it was sought under them to collect penalties, were over-
ruled and the laws held to be nugatory when penalties were
sought to be collected for a violation of their provisions. The
law of 1899 contained no exemption in favor of any class, and
this law has been held by the Supreme Court of Texas, in
State v. Laredo Ice Co., 96 Texas, 461, to be a valid and con-
stitutional enactment.
The questions in this case are, first, is the Anti-Trust Act
of Texas of 1899 constitutional; and, second, conceding that
the acts of 1889 arid 1895 are not constitutional to the extent
of warranting the collection of penalties for a violation of their
provisions, is it within the power of the courts to forfeit the
permit which authorizes a foreign corporation to transact
business in the State of Texas for committing the acts which
by such statutes they are prohibited from conmitting under
penalty of forfeiting such permits?
