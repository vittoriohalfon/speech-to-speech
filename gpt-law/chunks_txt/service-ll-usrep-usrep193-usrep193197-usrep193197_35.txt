three per cent of their interstate business they would be com-

It has been the ever present aim of those dominating the
policy of the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific, during
the past few years, to bring about a community of interest or
some closer form of union to the end that the motive from
which competition springs might be extinguished. On at
least three prior occasions Mr. Ill and Mr. Morgan and their
associates acted in concert in transactions affecting both roads:
the attempted transfer of half the stock of the Northern Pacific
to the Great Northern in exchange for a guarantee of the bonds
of the Northern Pacific which was held to be violative of the
laws of Minnesota, Pearsall v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 161
U. S. 646; the joint purchase of the Burlington in 1901; in
the events leading up to the panic of May, 1901. After the
refusal to admit the Union Pacific to an interest in the
Burlington purchase, those in control of the Union Pacific
attempted to acquire control of the Northern Pacific and as
soon as Mr. Hill and Mr. Morgan heard of this attempt they
reached an understanding to oppose it in concert, and this
resulted in the threat to retire the preferred stock of the
Northern Pacific, and the subsequent conference at which the
plan announced in the statement of June 1, in the Wall Street
Summary, was arranged. The testimony of defendants shows
that the incorporation of the Securities Company, and its
acquisition of a large majority of the stock of both railway
companies were the designed results of a plan or understanding
between the defendants Hill and Morgan and their associates,
which was carried out to the letter by the parties thereto.
The facts, as the Government asserts them, are recapitulated
in the opinion of the Circuit Court.
On the facts as proved the Government maintains that a
combination has been accomplished by means of the Securities
Company which is in violation of ยง 1 of the act of July 2, 1890;
that the defendants have monopolized or attempted to monop-
olize a part of the interstate or foreign commerce of the United

States and that if either result has been accomplished, the
relief granted by the Circuit Court was authorized by law.
The contention as to whether the Anti-Trust Act is or is not, a
criminal statute is not material. Nor was it in the Joint
Traffic Case, 171 U. S. 505. The primary aim of Congress
in passing the act was not to create new offenses but to pro-
nounce and declare a rule of public policy to cover a field
wherein the Federal government has supreme and exclusive
jurisdiction. As the United States has no common law, con-
tracts in restraint of trade would not be repugnant to any
law or rule of policy of the United States in the absence of a
statute, and the controlling purpose of the act was to declare
that the public policy of the nation forbade contracts, com-
binations, conspiracies, and monopolies in restraint of inter-
state and international trade and commerce, and the jurisdic-
tion conferred upon courts of equity to restrain violations of
the act was intended as a means to uphold and enforce the
principle of public policy therein asserted, not as a means to
prevent the commission of crimes. United States v. Trans-Mo.
Freight Assn., 166 U. S. 290, 342.
If the Anti-Trust Act is a criminal statute, it is also in the
highest degree a remedial statute; as such it is invoked in the
case at bar, and as such it ought to be construed liberally and
given the widest effect consistent with the language employed.
It ought not to be frittered away by the refinements of criti-
cism. Broom's Legal Maxims, 5th Am. ed., 3d London ed.,
80; Potter's Dwarris on Stat. and Const. 231, 234; Pierce and
Hopper, Str. 253. It makes no difference in the application
of these rules that the statutes have a penal as well as a re-
medial side. Ch. Prac. 215.
A statute may be penal in one part and remedial in another
part. But in the same act a strict construction may be put
on a penal clause and a liberal construction on a remedial
clause. Sedgwick on Construction of Statutory and Consti-
tutional Law, (2d ed.) 309, 310; Dwarris on Statutes, 653,
655; Hyde v. Cogan, 2 Doug. 702.

193 U. S. Argument of Attorney General for United States.
The Anti-Trust Act was purposely framed in broad and
general language in order to defeat subterfuges designed to
evade it. It is framed in sweeping and comprehensive language
which includes every combination, regardless of its form or
structure, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several
States or with foreign nations, and every person, natural or
artificial, monopolizing, attempting to monopolize, or com-
bining with any other person to monopolize any part of such
trade or commerce.
The form or framework is immaterial. Congress, no doubt,
anticipated that attempts would be made to defeat its will
through the "contrivances of powerful and ingenious minds,"
and to meet these it used the broad and all-embracing language
found in the act; and it is in this light that that language is
to be construed. And the device of a holding corporation
for the purpose of circumventing the law can be no more
effectual than any other means. Noyes on Intercorporate
Relations, ยง 393.
This court has decided that this act applies to common
carriers by railroad, as well as all other persons, natural or
artificial. Trans-Missouri Case, 166 U. S. 290. The words
in restraint of trade as used in the act extend to any and all
restraints whether reasonable or unreasonable, partial or total,
and there are peculiar reasons why this applies to railroad
corporations.
In exercising its powers over commerce Congress may to
some extent limit the right of private contract, the right to
buy and sell property, without violating the Fifth Amend-
ment. It may declare that no contract, combination, or
monopoly which restrains trade or commerce by shutting
out the operation of the general law of competition shall be
legal. Trans-Missouri Case, supra; Joint Traffic Case, supra;
Addyston Pipe Co. Case, 175 U. S. 211.
When its natural effect is to stifle, smother, destroy, prevent,
or shut out competition, the agreement or combination is in
restraint of trade or commerce and illegal under section 1 of
