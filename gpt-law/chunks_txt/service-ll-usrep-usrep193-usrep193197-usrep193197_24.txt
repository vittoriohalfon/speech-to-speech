curities Co., with their help, of a large majority of the shares
of each of the defendant railway companies in exchange for
its own shares.
The things so to be done or procured to be done (whether
taken separately or together) are such as do not and cannot in
any wise restrain interstate commerce, and hence a combina-
tion or conspiracy to do them or procure them to be done is
not in restraint of interstate commerce.
The Circuit Court erred in holding (1) that the Securities
Co., having acquired such majority of shares, has power to
suppress competition between the railway companies. In
fact, the Securities Co. is without power to suppress com-
petition. It is a mere shareholder and not a director. The
office of director is created by the State and not by the share-
holder. As to power of directors being distinct from those of
shareholders, see Hoyt v. Thompson, 19 N. Y. 207, 216; Bur-
rill v. Nahant Bank, 2 Mete. 163; Pullman Car Co. v. Mis-
souri Pac. Ry. Co., 115 U. S. 587. The charter of each rail-
way company gives to the board of directors all the powers
attributed to it in the foregoing decisions. Rev. Stat. Wiscon-
sin, 1878, c. 87, ยง 1804; Gen. Stat. Minnesota, 1894, ยง 2717;
(2) that it obtained and holds such power by means of and as
a party to the combination or conspiracy and not as an incident
of its ownership of the shares; (3) that the possession of such
power to suppress competition is of itself, and irrespective of
its exercise, a restraint of interstate commerce; and there-
fore (4) the combination or conspiracy in question was in
restraint of such commerce.
5. The petition does not allege nor do the proofs disclose
any facts showing a monopoly or a conspiracy or attempt to
monopolize any interstate or foreign commerce. For definition
of monopoly, see Texas Pacific v. Interstate Coni. Coin., 162
U. S. 197, 210; United States v. Freight Association, 166 U. S.
290; Pearsall v. Great Northern, 161 U. S. 646, 676; United
States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1, 10; In re Corning, 51

193 U. S. Argument of Mr. Young for Appellants.
6. The case is not within the Anti-Trust Act, for in any view
of the matters complained of, their effect upon commerce-
whether much or little, for good or for ill-is indirect and
remote. The Anti-Trust Act and the regulative power of Con-
gress under the commerce clause of the Constitution, are alike
strictly limited to matters which directly and immediately
affect interstate or foreign commerce.
In determining what is a combination in direct restraint of
commerce the distinction between direct and indirect regula-
tions of commerce becomes important, see Fargo v. Michigan,
121 U. S. 230; Phila. S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U. S. 326,
328; N. Y., L. Erie &c. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 158 U. S. 431;
Maine v. Grand Trunk Railway Co., 142 U. S. 217; Pickard
v. Pullman Co., 117 U. S. 34; Pullman Co. v. Pennsylvania,
141 U. S. 18, 25. In the declarations of the limitations of
the act and of the power of Congress, the court has merely
repeated its settled doctrine. Hooper v. California, 155 U. S.
648, 655; Williams v. Fears, 179 U. S. 270, 278.
Where subjects for commercial regulation are of a nature
to require or admit of one uniform system or plan of regula-
tion, the power to regulate them is exclusively in Congress,
and any attempted regulation by a State whether to enlarge or
restrain, is simply ultra vires, for it is a usurpation of a power
vested exclusively in Congress. Wabash Railway Co. v. Illi-
nois, 118 U. S. 557, 574; Robbins v. Shelby Taxing District,
120 U. S. 489, 492; Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania,
122 U. S. 326, 336; Bowman v. Chicago, etc., R. R. Co., 125
V. S. 465, 480. Anything, therefore, not exclusively within
the jurisdiction of Congress is not within the act.
7. The very general language of the Anti-Trust Act was
not intended to include combinations to purchase railways or
railway shares, competing or non-competing, nor consolida-
tions actual or "virtual" of railways or railway companies.
Congress, when passing the act did so with full knowledge
of the situation. Ches. & 0. Tel. Co. v. Manning, 186 U. S.
238, 245. It knew that the railway systems of the country

rested on such combinations authorized by state laws, some
of them having existed many years.
These are matters of public history and within the knowl-
edge of the court. Ohio L. & T. Co. v. Debold, 16 How. 416,
435; R. R. Co. v. Maryland, 21 Wall. 456, 469; Brown v. Piper,
91 U. S. 37, 42; Phillips v. Detroit, 111 U. S. 604, 606; Lehigh
Valley v. Pennsylania, 145 U. S. 192, 201; Louis ille & Nash-
ville v. Kentucky, 161 U. S. 677, 699; Preston v. Browder, 1
Wheat. 115, 121; United States v. Union Pacific, 91 U. S. 72,
79; Platt v. Union Pacific, 99 U. S. 48, 55.
If Congress had meant to declare such consolidations and
stock purchases of competing companies to be illegal, the se-
curities issued by them void and state legislation unconstitu-
tional, it would have said so in plain, specific and apt language.
The construction put on the act by all branches of the gov-
ernment and by everybody down to the commencement of
this proceeding, has been in full accord with our position
that the act has nothing to do with combinations to own rail-
ways or railway shares. The following consolidations of coni-
peting railroad lines existed at the time of the passage of the
act or have been effected since that time: Boston & Maine
Railroad Company and competing lines; New York, New
Haven & Hartford Railroad Co., and New England Railroad
Co. and other roads; New York Central Railroad and the
West Shore and Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg and other
railroad companies; Pennsylvania Railroad Company and Bal-
timore and Ohio and other companies; the Reading Company.
8. Even though the Government were entitled to any inl-
junction, the decree goes far beyond what the Government
was entitled to receive, or the Circuit Court authorized to
grant.
