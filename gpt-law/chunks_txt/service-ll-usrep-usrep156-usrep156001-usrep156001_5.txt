UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.
Opinion of the Court.
It is vital that the independence of the commercial power,
and of the police power, and the delimitation between them,
however sometimes perplexing, should always be recognized
and observed, for while the one furnishes the strongest bond
of union, the other is essential to the preservation of the.
autonomy of the States as required by our dual form of
government, and acknowledged evils, however grave and
urgent they may appear to be, had better be borne, than the,
risk be run, m the effort to suppress them, of more serious
consequences by resort to expedients of even doubtful constl-
tutionality
It will be perceived how far-reaching the proposition is that.
the power of dealing with a monopoly directly may be exer-
cised by the general government whenever interstate or inter-
national commerce may be ultimately affected. The regulation
of commerce applies to the subjects of commerce and not to
matters of internal police. Contracts to buy, sell, or exchange
goods to be transported among the several States, the trans-
portation and its instrumentalities, and articles bought, sold,
or exchanged for the purposes of such transit among the
States, or put in the way of transit, may be regulated, but,
this is because they form part of interstate trade or com-
merce. The fact that an article is manufactured for export.
to another State does not of itself make it an article of inter-
state commerce, and the intent of the manufacturer does not.
determine the time when the article or product passes from
the control of the State and belongs to commerce. This was.
so ruled in Coe v Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 525, in which the ques-
tion before the court was whether certain logs cut at a place.
in New Hampshire and hauled to a river town for the purpose.
of transportation to the State of Maine were liable to be taxed
like other property in the State of New Hampshire. Mr.
Justice Bradley, delivering the opinion of the court, said
"Does the owner's state of mind in relation to the goods,
that is, his intent to export them, and his partial preparation
to do so, exempt them from taxation 2 This is the precise
question for solution. There must be a point of time
when they cease to be governed exclusively by the domestic.

law and begin to be governed and protected by the national
law of commercial regulation, and that moment seems to us
to be a legitimate one for this purpose, in which they com-
mence their final movement from the State of their origin to
that of their destination."
And again, in .Kdd v Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 20, 21, 22,
where the question was discussed whether the right of a State
to enact a statute prohibiting within its limits the manufacture
of intoxicating liquors, except for certain purposes, could be
overthrown by the fact that the manufacturer intended to ex-
port the liquors when made, it was held that the intent of the
manufacturer did not determine the time when the article or
product passed from the control of the State and belonged to
commerce, and that, therefore, the statute, in omitting to ex-
cept from its operation the manufacture of intoxicating liquors
within the limits of the State for export, did not constitute an
unauthorized interference with the right of Congress to regu-
late commerce. And Mr. Justice Lamar remarked "No dis-
tinction is more popular to the common mind, or more clearly
expressed in economic and political literature, than that between
manufacture and commerce. Manufacture is transformation-
the fashioning of raw materials into a change of form for use.
The functions of commerce are different. The buying and
selling and the transportation incidental thereto constitute
commerce, and the regulation of commerce in the constitu-
tional sense embraces the regulation at least of such trans-
portation. If it be held that the term includes the
regulation of all such manufactures as are intended to be
the subject of commercial transactions in the future, it is im-
possible to deny that it would also include all productive in-
dustries that contemplate the same thing. The result would
be that Congress would be invested, to the exclusion of the
States, with the power to regulate, not only manufactures,
but also agriculture, horticulture, stock raising, domestic fish-
eries, mining-in short, every branch of human industry
For is there one of them that does not contemplate, more or
less clearly, an interstate or foreign market 2 Does not the
wheat grower of the Northwest or the cotton planter of the

-South, plant, cultivate, and harvest his crop with an eye on
the prices at Liverpool, New York, and Chicago The power
being vested in Congress and denied to the States, it would
follow as an inevitable result that the duty would devolve on
-Congress to regulate all of these delicate, multiform and vital
interests -interests which in their nature are and must be
local in all the details of their successful management.
'The demands of such a supervision would require, not uniform
legislation generally applicable throughout the United. States,
but a swarm of statutes only locally applicable and utterly in-
consistent. Any movement toward the establishment of rules
-of production in this vast country, with its many different
-climates and opportunities, could only be at the sacrifice of
the peculiar advantages of a large part of the localities in it, if
not of every one of them. On the other hand, any movement
toward the local, detailed and incongruous legislation reqmred
by such interpretation would be about the widest possible
departure from the declared object of the clause in question.
Nor this alone. Even in the exercise of the power contended
for, Congress would be confined to the regulation, not of certain
branches of industry, however numerous, but to those instances
in each and every branch where the producer contemplated
an interstate market. These instances would be almost infi-
nite, as we have seen, but still there would always remain the
possibility, and often it would be the case, that the producer
contemplated a domestic market. In that case the supervisory
power must be executed by the State, and the interminable
trouble would be presented, that whether the one power or
the other should exercise the authority in question would be
-determined, not by any general or intelligible rule, but by the
secret and changeable intention of the producer in each and
every act of production. A situation more paralyzing to the
-state governments, and more provocative of conflicts between
the general government and the States, and less likely to have
been what the framers of the Constitution intended, it would
be difficult to imagine." And see 7eazze v -Moor, 14 How.
