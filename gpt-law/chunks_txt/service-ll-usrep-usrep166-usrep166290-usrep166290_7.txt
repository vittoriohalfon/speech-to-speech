OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.
The prayer of the bill filed.in this suit asks not only for the
dissolution of the association, but, among other things, that
the defendants should be restrained from continuing in a like
combination, and that they should be enjoined from further
conspiring, agreeing or combining and acting together to
maintain rules and regulations and rates for carrying freight
upon their several lines, etc. The mere dissolution of the
association is not the most-important object of this litigation.
The judgment of the court is sought upon the question of the
legality of the agreement itself for the carrying out of which
the association was formed, and if such agreement be declared
to be illegal, the court is asked not only to dissolve the asso-
ciation named in the bill, but that the defendants should be
enjoined for the future.
The defendants, in bringing to the notice of the court the
fact of the dissolution of the association, take pains to show
that such dissolution had no connection or relation whatever
with the pendency of this suit, and that the association was
not terminated on that account. They do not admit the
illegality of the agreement, nor do they allege their purpose
not to enter into a similar one in the immediate future. On
the contrary, by their answers the defendants claim that the
agreement is a perfectly proper, legitimate and salutary one,
and that it or one like it is necessary to the -prosperity of the
companies. If the injunction were limited to the prevention
of any. action by the defendants under the particular agree-
ment set out, or if the judgment were to be limited to the
dissolution of the association mentioned in the bill, the relief
obtained would be totally inadequate to the necessities of the
occasion, provided an agreement of that nature were deter-
mined to be illegal. The injunction should go further, and
enjoin defendants from entering into or acting under any
similar agreement in the future. In other words, the relief
granted should be adequate to the occasion.
As an answer to the fact of the dissolution of the association,
it is shown on the part of the Government that these very
defendants, or most of them, immediately entered into a sub-
stantially similar agreement, which was to remain in force for

Opinion of the Court.
a certain time, and under which the companies acted, and in
regard to which it does not appear that they are not still act-
ing. If the mere dissolution of the association worked an
abatement of the suit as to all the defendants, as is the claim
made on their part, it is plain that they have thus discovered
an effectual means to prevent the judgment of this court
being given upon the question really ifivolved in the case.
The defendants having succeeded in the court below, it would
only be necessary thereafter to dissolve their association and
instantly form another of a similar kind, and the fact of the
dissolution would prevent an appeal to this court or procure
its dismissal if taken. This result does not and ought not to
follow. Although the general rule is that equity does not
interfere simply to restrain a possible future violation of law,
yet where parties have entered into an illegal agreement and
are acting under it, and there is no adequate remedy at law
and the jurisdiction of the court has attached by the filing
of a bill to restrain such or any like action under a similar
agreement, and a trial has been had, and judgment entered,
the appellate jurisdiction of this court is not ousted by a
simple dissolution of the association, effected subsequently to
the entry of judgment in the suit.
Private'parties may settle their controversies at any time,
and rights which a plaintiff may have had at the time of the
commencement of the action may terminate before judgment
is obtained or while the case is on appeal, and in any such
case the court, being informed of the facts, will proceed no
further in the action. Here, however, there has been no ex-
tinguishment of the rights (whatever they are) of the public,
the enforcement of which the Government has endeavored to
procure by a judgment of a court under the provisions of the
act of Congress above cited. The defendants cannot foreclose
those rights nor prevent the assertion thereof by the Govern-
ment as a substantial trustee for the public under the act of
Congress, by any such action as has been taken in this case.
By designating the agreement in question as illegal and the
alleged combination as an unlawful one, we simply mean to
say that such is the character of the agreement as claimed by

the Government. That question the Government has the
right to bring before the court and obtain its judgment
thereon. Whether the agreement is of that character is the
question herein to be decided.
We think, therefore, the first ground urged by defendants
for the dismissal of the appeal is untenable.
We have no difficulty either in sustaining the jurisdiction of
this court in regard to the second ground, that of the amount
in controversy in the suit.
The bill need not state, in so many words, that a certain
amount exceeding one thousand dollars is in controversy in
order that this court may have jurisdiction on appeal. The
statutory amount must as a matter of fact be in controversy,
yet that fact may appear by affidavit. after the appeal is
taken to this court, Whiteside v. ilaselton, 110 U. S. 296; Red
River Cattle Co. v. Needham, 137 U. S. 632, or it may be
made to appear in such other manner as shall establish it to
the satisfaction of the court. A stipulation between the par-
ties as to the amount is not controlling, but in the discretion
of the court it may be regarded in a particular case, and with
reference to the other facts appearing in the record as suffi-
cient proof of the amount in controversy to sustain the juris-
diction of this court.
The bill shows here an agreement entered into (as stated in
the agreement itself) for the purpose of maintaining reasonable
rates to be received by each company executing the agreement,
and the stipulation entered into between the parties hereto
shows that the daily freight charges on interstate shipments
collected by the railway companies at points where they
compete with each other were, at the time of the makiig of
the agreement mentioned in the pleadings herein and have
been since, more than one thousand dollars. This agreement
so made, the Government alleges, is illegal as being in restraint
of trade, and was entered into between the companies for the
purpose of enhancing the freight rates. The companies, while
denying the illegality of the agreement or its purpose to be
other than to maintain reasonable rates, yet allege that with-
out some such agreement the competition between them for
