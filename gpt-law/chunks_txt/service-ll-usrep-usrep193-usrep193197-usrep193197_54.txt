holders in exchange for its own stock; and nothing herein con-
tained shall be construed as prohibiting the Northern Securities
Company from making such transfer and assignments of the
stock aforesaid to such person or persons as may now be the
holders and owners of its own stock originally issued in ex-
change or in payment for the stock claimed to have been
acquired by it in the aforesaid railway companies."
Subsequently, and before the appeal to this court was per-
fected, an order was made in the Circuit Court to this effect:
"That upon the giving of an approved bond to the United
States by or on behalf of the defendants in the sum of fifty
thousand dollars conditioned to prosecute their appeal with
effect and to pay all damages which may result to the United
States from this order, that portion of the injunction contained
in the final decree herein which forbids the Northern Pacific
Railway Company and the Great Northern Railway Company,
their officers, directors, servants and agents, from paying
dividends to the Northern Securities Company on account of
stock in either of the railway companies which the Securities
Company claims to own and hold, is suspended during the
pendency of the appeal allowed herein this day. All other
portions of the decree and of the injunction it contains remain
in force and are unaffected by this order."
No valid objection can be made to the decree below, in form
or in substance. If there was a combination or conspiracy in
violation of the act of Congress, between the stockholders of
the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific Railway com-
panies, whereby the Northern Securities Company was formed
as a holding corporation, and whereby interstate commerce
over the lines of the constituent companies was restrained, it
must follow that the court, in execution of that act, and to
defeat the efforts to evade it, could prohibit the parties to the
combination from doing the specific things which being done
would affect the result denounced by the act. To say that the
court could not go so far is to say that it is powerless to enforce
the act or to suppress the illegal combination, and powerless

to protect the rights of the public as against that combina-
tion.
It is here suggested that the alleged combination had ac-
complished its object before the commencement of this suit,
in that the Securities Company had then organized, and had
actually received a majority of the stock of the two constituent
companies; therefore, it is argued, no effective relief can now
be granted to the Government. This same view was pressed
upon the Circuit Court, and was rejected. It was completely
answered by that court when it said: "Concerning the second
contention, we observe that it would be a novel, not to say
absurd, interpretation of the Anti-Trust Act to hold that after
an unlawful combination is formed and has acquired the
power which it had no right to acquire, namely, to restrain
commerce by suppressing competition, and is proceeding to
use it and execute the purpose for which the combination was
formed, it must be left in possession of the power that it has
acquired, with full freedom to exercise it. Obviously the act,
when fairly interpreted, will bear no such construction. Con-
gress aimed to destroy the power to place any direct restraint
on interstate trade or commerce, when by any combination
or conspiracy, formed by either natural or artificial persons,
such a power had been acquired; and the Government may
intervene and demand relief as well after the combination is
fully organized as while it is in process of formation. In this
instance, as we have already said, the Securities Company
made itself a party to a combination in restraint of interstate
commerce that antedated its organization, as soon as it came
into existence, doing so, of course, under the direction of the
very individuals who promoted it." The Circuit Court has
done only what the actual situation demanded. Its decree
has done nothing more than to meet the requirements of the
statute. It could not have done less without declaring its
impotency in dealing with those who have violated the law.
The decree, if executed, will destroy, not the property interests
of the original stockholders of the constituent companies, but

the power of the holding corporation as the instrument of an
illegal combination of which it was the master spirit, to do
that which, if done, would restrain interstate and international
commerce. The exercise of that power being restrained, the
object of Congress will be accomplished; left undisturbed,
the act in question will be valueless for any practical pur-
pose.
It is said that this statute contains criminal provisions and
must therefore be strictly construed. The rule upon that sub-
ject is a very ancient and salutary one. It means only that
we must not bring cases within the provisions of such a statute
that are not clearly embraced by it, nor by narrow, technical
or forced construction of words, exclude cases from it that are
obviously within its provisions. What must be sought for
always is the intention of the legislature, and the duty of the
court is to give effect to that intention as disclosed by the
words used.
As early as the case of King v. Inhabitants of Hodnett, 1 T. 11.
96, 101, Mr. Justice Buller said: "It is not true that the courts
in the exposition of penal statutes are to narrow the construc-
tion." In United States v. Wiltbergqer, 5 Wheat. 76, 95, Chief
Justice Marshall, delivering the judgment of this court and
referring to the rule that penal statutes are to be construed
strictly, said: "It is a modification of the ancient maxim, and
amounts to this, that though penal laws are to be construed
strictly, they are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat
the obvious intention of the legislature. The maxim is not
to be so applied as to narrow the words of the statute to the
exclusion of cases which those words, in their ordinary accepta-
tion, or in that sense in which the legislature has obviously
used them, would comprehend. The intention of the legis-
lature is to be collected from the words they employ. Where
there is no ambiguity in the words, there is no room for con-
struction." In United States v. Morris, 14 Pet. 464, 475, this
court, speaking by Chief Justice Taney, said: "In expounding
a penal statute the court certainly will not extend it beyond
