ANDERSON v.. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 181. Argued February 25, 28, 1898.- Decided October 24, 1898.
The Traders' Live Stock Exchange was an unincorporated association in
Kansas City, whose members bore much the same relation to it, and
through it carried on much the same business as that carried on by the
members of the Kansas City Live Stock Exchange, considered and passed
upon in Hopkins v. United States, just decided. The main difference was,
that the members of the Traders' Exchange, defendants in the present
proceedings, were themselves purchasers of cattle on the market, while
the defendants In the former case were commission merchants who sold
cattle upon commission as a compensation for their service. The
articles of association of the Traders' Exchange contained the follow-
ing preamble: 1. We, the undersigned, for the purpose of organizing and
maintaining a business exchange, not for pecuniary profit or gain, but to
promote and protect all interests connected with the buying and selling of
live stock at the Kansas City Stock Yards, and to cultivate courteous and
manly conduct towards each other, and give dignity and responsibility to
yard traders, have associated ourselves together under the name of
Traders' Live Stock Exchangd, and hereby agree, each with the other,
that we will faithfully observe and be bound by the following rules and
by-laws and such new rules, additions or amendments as may from time to
time be adopted in conformity with the provisions thereof from the date
of organization." The rules objected to in the bill in this case were the
following: "Rule 10. This exchange will not recognize any yard trader
unless he is a member of the Traders' Live Stock Exchange. Rule 11.

ANDERSON v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.
When there are two or more parties trading together as partners, they
shall each and all of them be members of this exchange. Rule 12. No
member of this exchange shall employ -any person to buy or sell cattle.
unless such person hold a certificate of membership in this exchange.
Rule 13. No member of this exchange shall be allowed to pay any order
buyer or salesman any sum of money as a fee for buying cattle from or
selling cattle to such party." Held:
(1) That this court is not called upon to decide whether the defendants
are or are not engaged in interstate commerce, because if it be
conceded they are so engaged, the agreement as evidenced by the
by-laws is not one in restraint of that trade, nor is there any com-
bination to monopolize or attempt to monopolize such trade within
the meaning of the act;
(2) That, following the preceding case, in order to come within the pro-
visions of the statute the direct effect of an agreement or combi-
nation must be in restraint of that trade or commerce which is
among the several States, or with foreign nations;
(3)T hat where the subject-matter of the agreement does not directly
relate to and act upon and embrace interstate commerce, and
where the undisputed facts clearly show that the purpose of the
agreement was not to regulate, obstruct or restrain that commerce,
but that it was entered into with the object of properly and fairly
regulating the transaction of the business in which the parties to
the agreement were engaged, such agreement will be upheld as not
within the statute, where it can be seen that the character and
terms of the agreement are well calculated to attain the purpose
for which it was formed, and where the effect of its formation
and enforcement upon interstate trade or commerce is in any event
but indirect and incidental, and not iti purpose or object;
(4) That the rules are evidently of a character to enforce the purpose
and object of the exchange as set forth in the preamble, and that
for such purpose they are reasonable and fair, and that they can
possibly affect interstate trade or commerce in but a remote way,
and are not void as violations of the act of Congress.
THis suit is somewhat similar to the Hopkins suit, just de-
cided, and was brought by the United States against the
defendants named, who were citizens and residents of the
Western Division of the Western District of Missouri and mem-
bers of a voluntary unincorporated association known and
designated as the Traders' Live Stock Exchange, the suit
being brought for the purpose of obtaining a decree dissolving
the exchange and enjoining the members the'eof from enter-
ing into or continuing any sort of combination to deprive
any people engaged in shipping, selling, buying and handling

live stock (received from other States and from the Territo-
ries, intended to be sold at the Kansas City market), of free
access to the markets at Kansas-City, and to the same facilities
afforded by the Kansas City stock yards, to defendants and
their associate members of the Traders' Live Stock Exchange.
The bill was filed under the direction of the Attorney
General of the United States. by the United States District
Attorney for the Western District of Missouri. It alleged in
substance that the exchange was governed by a board of
eight directors, who carried on the business thereof with the
consent and approbation of the defendants, they personally
being members of the exchange. It then made the same
allegations in relation to the stock yards being partly in
Kansas City, Kansas, and partly in Kansas City, Missouri,
that are contained in the bill in the Hopkins case, just de-
cided, and also as to the sales of herds or droves of cattle
which were at the time of the .sale partly in one State and
partly in another. It is further alleged that the Kansas City
stock yards are a public market, and, next to the market at
Chicago in the State of Illinois, the largest live stock market
in the world, and vast numbers of cattle, hogs and other live
stock are received annually at the market, shipped from various
States and from the Territories, and are sold at the market to
buyers who reside in other States and Territories, and who
reship the stock; that the stock is shipped to the market
under contracts by which the shipper is permitted to unload the
stock at the Kansas City stock yards, rest, water and feed
the same, and is accorded the privilege of selling the stock on
the Kansas City market if the prices prevailing at the time
justify the sale, and many head of such stock are so sold;
that prior to the month of March, 1897, as alleged, the de-
fendants herein were engaged as speculators at the Kansas
City stock yards, and were buying upon the market and re-
selling upon the same market and reshipping to other markets
in other States the cattle so received at the Kansas City stock
yards; that-all the live stock shipped to and received at these
stock yards is consigned to commissioh merchants, who take
charge of the stock when it is received, and who sell the same
