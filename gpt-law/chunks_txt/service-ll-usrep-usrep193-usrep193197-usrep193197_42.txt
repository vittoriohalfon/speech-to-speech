trict in which the defendant resides or is found, without re-
spect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold
the damages by him sustained, and the costs of suit, including
a reasonable attorney's fee.
"SEc. 8. That the word 'person,' or 'persons,' wherever used
in this act shall be deemed to include corporations and associa-
tions existing under or authorized by the laws of either the
United States, the laws of any of the Territories, the laws of
any State, or the laws of any foreign country."
Is the case as presented by the pleadings and the evidence
one of a combination or a conspiracy in restraint of trade or
commerce among the States, or with foreign states? Is it one
in which the defendants are properly chargeable with monop-
olizing or attempting to monopolize any part of such trade
or commerce? Let, us see what are the facts disclosed by the
record.
The Great Northern Railway Company and the Northern
Pacific Railway Company owned, controlled and operated sep-
arate lines of railway-the former road extending from Su-
perior, and from Duluth and St. Paul, to Everett, Seattle, and
Portland, with a branch line to Helena; the latter, extending
from Ashland, and from Duluth and St. Paul, to Helena, Spo-
kane, Seattle, Tacoma and Portland. The two lines, main
and branches, about 9,000 miles in length, were and are paral-
lel and competing lines across the continent through the north-
ern tier of States between the Great Lakes and the Pacific,
and the two companies were engaged in active competition for
freight and passenger traffic, each road connecting at its re-
spective terminals with lines of railway, or with lake and river
steamers, or with seagoing vessels.
Prior to 1893 the Northern Pacific system was owned or
controlled and operated by the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company, a corporation organized under certain acts and res-
olutions of Congress. That company becoming insolvent, its
road and property passed into the hands of receivers appointed
by courts of the United States. In advance of foreclosure and

sale a majority of its bondholders made an arrangement with
the Great Northern Railway Company for a virtual consolida-
tion of the two systems, and for giving the practical control
of the Northern Pacific to the Great Northern. That was the
arrangement declared in Pearsall v. Great Northern Railway
Company, 161 U. S. 646, to be illegal under the statutes of
Minnesota which forbade any railroad corporation or the
purchasers or managers of any corporation, to consolidate
the stock, property or franchises of such corporation, or to
lease or purchase the works or franchises of, or in any way
control, other railroad corporations owning or having under
their control parallel or competing lines. Gen. Laws, Minn.
1874, c. 29; ch. 1881.
Early in 1901 the Great Northern and Northern Pacific
Railway companies, having in view the ultimate placing of
their two systems under a common control, united in the pur-
chase of the capital stock of the Chicago, Burlington and
Quincy Railway Company, giving in payment, upon an agreed
basis of exchange, the joint bonds of the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific Railway companies, payable in twenty years
from date, with interest at 4 per cent per annum. In this
manner the two purchasing companies became the owners of
$107,000,000 of the $112,000,000 total capital stock of the
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railway Company, whose
lines aggregated about 8,000 miles, and extended from St.
Paul to Chicago and from St. Paul and Chicago to Quincy,
Burlington, Des Moines, St. Louis, Kansas City, St. Joseph,
Omaha, Lincoln, Denver, Cheyenne and Billings, where it
connected with the Northern Pacific railroad. By this pur-
chase of stock the Great Northern and Northern Pacific ac-
quired full control of the Chicago, Burlington. and Quincy
main line and branches.
Prior to November 13, 1901, defendant Hill and associate
stockholders of the Great Northern Railway Company, and
defendant Morgan and associate stockholders of the Northern
Pacific Railway Company, entered into a combination to form,

under the laws of New Jersey, a holding corporation, to be
called the Northern Securities Company, with a capital stock
of $400,000,000, and to which company, in exchange for its
own capital stock upon a certain basis and at a certain rate,
was to be turned over the capital stock, or a controlling inter-
est in the capital stock, of each of the constituent railway
companies, with power in the holding corporation to vote such
stock and in all respects to act as the owner thereof, and to
do whatever it might deem necessary in aid of such railway
companies or to enhance the value of their stocks. In this
manner the interests of individual stockholders in the prop-
erty and franchises of the two independent and coml)ethlg
railway companies were to be converted into an interest in the
property and franchises of the holding corporation. Thus,
as stated in Article VI of the bill, "by making the stockhold-
ers of each system jointly interested in both systems, and
by practically pooling the earnings of both for the benefit of
the former stockholders of each, and by vesting the selection
of the directors and officers of each system in a common
body, to wit, the holding corporation, with not only the
power but the duty to pursue a policy which would promote
the interests, not of one system at the expense of the other,
but of both at the expense of the public, all inducement for
competition between the two systems was to be removed, a
virtual consolidation effected, and a monopoly of the inter-
state and foreign commerce formerly carried on by the two
systems as independent competitors established."
In pursuance of this combination and to effect its objects,
the defendant, the Northern Securities Company, was organ-
ized November 13, 1901, under the laws of New Jersey.
Its certificate of incorporation stated that the objects for
which the company was formed were: "1. To acquire by
purchase, subscription or otherwise, and to hold as investment,
any bonds or other securities or evidences of indebtedness, or
any shares of capital stock created or issued by any other cor-
poration or corporations, association or associations, of the
