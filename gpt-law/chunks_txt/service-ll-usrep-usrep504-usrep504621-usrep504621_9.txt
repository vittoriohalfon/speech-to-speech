REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting
Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United
States, supra, at 51. The view advanced by the Court of
Appeals does not sanction price fixing in areas regulated by
a State "not inconsistent with the antitrust laws." Ante, at
636. A State must establish, staff, and fund a program to
approve jointly set rates or prices in order for any activity
undertaken by private individuals under that program to be
laws.4
immune under the antitrust
The Court rejects the test adopted by the Court of Ap-
peals, stating that it cannot be the end of the inquiry. In-
stead, the party seeking immunity must "show that state
officials have undertaken the necessary steps to determine
the specifics of the price-fixing or ratesetting scheme."
Ante, at 638.5 Such an inquiry necessarily puts the federal
court in the position of determining the efficacy of a particu-
lar State's regulatory scheme, in order to determine whether
the State has met the "requisite level of active supervision."
Ante, at 637. The Court maintains that the proper state-
action inquiry does not determine whether a State has met
some "normative standard" in its regulatory practices.
Ante, at 634. But the Court's focus on the actions taken by
state regulators, i. e., the way the State regulates, necessar-
ily requires a judgment as to whether the State is sufficiently
active-surely a normative judgment.
4 In neither of the examples cited by the majority as instances of state
regulation not intended to authorize anticompetitive conduct would appli-
cation of a less detailed active supervision test change the result. In Pat-
rick v. Burget, supra, we concluded there was no immunity because the
State did not have the authority to review the anticompetitive action un-
dertaken by the peer review committee; in Cantor v. Detroit Edison Ca,
428 U. S. 579 (1976), it is unlikely that the clear articulation requirement
under our current jurisprudence would be met with respect to the market
for light bulbs.
6 It is not clear, from the Court's formulation, whether this is a separate
test applicable only to negative option regulatory schemes, or whether
it applies more generally to issues of immunity under the state-action
doctrine.

FTC v. TICOR TITLE INS. CO.
O'CONNOR, J., dissenting
The Court of Appeals found-properly, in my view-that
while the States at issue here did not regulate respondents'
rates with the vigor petitioner would have liked, the States'
supervision of respondents' conduct was active enough so as
to provide for immunity from antitrust liability. The Court
of Appeals, having concluded that the Federal Trade Com-
mission applied an incorrect legal standard, reviewed the
facts found by the Commission in light of the correct stand-
ard and reached a different conclusion. This does not consti-
tute a rejection of the Commission's factual findings.
I would therefore affirm the judgment below.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
dissenting.
Notwithstanding its assertions to the contrary, the Court
has diminished the States' regulatory flexibility by creating
an impossible situation for those subject to state regulation.
Even when a State has a "clearly articulated policy" author-
izing anticompetitive behavior-which the Federal Trade
Commission concedes was the case here-and even when the
State establishes a system to supervise the implementation
of that policy, the majority holds that a federal court may
later find that the State's supervision was not sufficiently
"substantial" in its "specifics" to insulate the anticompetitive
behavior from antitrust liability. Ante, at 635. Given the
threat of treble damages, regulated entities that have the
option of heeding the State's anticompetitive policy would be
foolhardy to do so; those that are compelled to comply are
less fortunate. The practical effect of today's decision will
likely be to eliminate so-called "negative option" regulation
from the universe of schemes available to a State that seeks
to regulate without exposing certain conduct to federal anti-
trust liability.
The Court does not dispute that each of the States at issue
in this case could have supervised respondents' joint rate-
making; rather, it argues that "the potential for state super-

vision was not realized in fact." Ante, at 638. Such an
after-the-fact evaluation of a State's exercise of its supervi-
sory powers is extremely unfair to regulated parties. Liabil-
ity under the antitrust laws should not turn on how enthusi-
astically a state official carried out his or her statutory
duties. The regulated entity has no control over the regula-
tor, and very likely will have no idea as to the degree of
scrutiny that its filings may receive. Thus, a party could
engage in exactly the same conduct in two States, each of
which had exactly the same policy of allowing anticompeti-
tive behavior and exactly the same regulatory structure, and
discover afterward that its actions in one State were immune
from antitrust prosecution, but that its actions in the other
resulted in treble-damages liability.
Moreover, even if a regulated entity could assure itself
that the State will undertake to actively supervise its rate
filings, the majority does not offer any guidance as to what
level of supervision will suffice. It declares only that the
State must "pla[y] a substantial role in determining the spe-
cifics of the economic policy." Ante, at 635. That standard
is not only ambiguous, but also runs the risk of being coun-
terproductive. The more reasonable a filed rate, the less
likely that a State will have to play any role other than sim-
ply reviewing the rate for compliance with statutory criteria.
Such a vague and retrospective standard, combined with the
threat of treble damages if that standard is not satisfied,
makes "negative option" regulation an unattractive option
for both States and the parties they regulate.
Finally, it is important to remember that antitrust actions
can be brought by private parties as well as by government
prosecutors. The resources of state regulators are strained
enough without adding the extra burden of asking them to
serve as witnesses in civil litigation and respond to allega-
tions that they did not do their job.
For these reasons, as well as those given by THE CHIEF
JUSTICE, I dissent.
