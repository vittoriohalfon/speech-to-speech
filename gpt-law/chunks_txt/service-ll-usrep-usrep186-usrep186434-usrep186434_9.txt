LANDER v. MERCANTILE BANK.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 227. Argued April 18, 1902.-Decided June 2, 1902.
This suit was brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern Division of Ohio, Eastern District, to restrain the collection of
certain taxes levied by the officers of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, upon the
appellee bank. The grounds of the suit were that the acts of the tax-
ing officers of said county were in violation of the " rights of th plaintiff
(appellee) and of its shareholders accorded to them by section 5219 of
the Revised Statutes of the United States, securing to said shareholders
a restriction of the rate and limit of taxes assessed upon their said shares
to that assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands-of individual
citizens of the State of Ohio." The bill alleged that the plaintiff (appel-
lee) was a national bank, and stated the capital stock of the bank and the
number of shares into which it was divided; that its cashier made the
proper returns of the resources and liabilities of the bank to the county
auditor; that the latter fixed the value thereof, as required by section 27 6
of the Revised Statutes of the State, after deducting the assessed value
of the real estate of the bank, and transmitted a statement of his action,
and a copy of the report made by the cashier, to the state board of eqal-
ization, for incorporated banks and that board, professing to act under
sections 2808 and 2809 of the Revisel Statut'es of the State, increased the
valuation of the shares without notice to the bank or to its shareholders,
and that the board was hence without jurisdiction to make such increase,
and "its action in respect thereto was void and of no effect." It was
averred ".that said state board of equalization knowingly and designedly
did fix a much higher per centum of valuation and assessment for taxa-
tion upon the shares of the plaintiff's capital stock than was assessed
