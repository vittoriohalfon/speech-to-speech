Opinion of the Court.
bound by mortgage or other encumbrance shall not be person-
ally liable for the payment of such ground rent, mortgage or
other encumbrance unless he shall, by an agreement in writing,
have expressly assumed a personal liability therefor, or there
shall be express words in the deed of conveyance stating that
the grant is made on condition of the grantee assuming such
personal liability therefor: _P'ovided, That the use of the
words ' under and subject to the payment of such ground rent,
mortgage or other encumbrance, shall not alone be construed
so as to make such grantee personally liable as aforesaid."
Under the various cases cited, and the statute above quoted,
we may assume that by the law of Pennsylvania the grantee
who simply takes a deed subject to the lien of a mortgage is at
most nothing more than an indemnitor of his grantor against
the payment of the mortgage or any part of it by such grantor.
There is no liability on the part of the grantee to the mort-
gagee so that the latter has any cause of action against him for
the payment of the mortgage. If the mortgagor be not liable
to pay at all there is no liability resting on the grantee to pay.
It then becomes necessary to determine what liability, if
any, rested upon the mortgagor. By reference to the fourth
article of the mortgage, already set forth in the statement of
facts, it will be seen that there is no personal liability on the
part of the mortgagor. There is no obligation, therefore, on
the part of The Penn Company to indemnify the mortgagor
company for any personal liability to pay the mortgage or any
part thereof, for no such liability exists. However much be-
low the amount of the mortgage the land should sell for is, so
far as this question is concerned, a matter of no legal interest
to the mortgagor company, and the fact in no way creates any
liability on its part. As there was no liability on the part of
the mortgagor to pay any portion of the debt secured by the
mortgage, and the liability, if any, to indemnify the mortgagor
on its covenant to insure is, as stated by the judge delivering
the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, incidental and sub-
ordinate to its liability to indemnify the mortgagor regarding
the mortgage debt, no such liability to indemnify upon the in-
surance covenant would seem to rest upon the defendant com-

pany or upon Kann, because there is none such existing in rela-
tion to the mortgage debt itself.
The covenant to insure does not run with the land, so that
one taking a conveyance comes under a primary obligation to
insure, over and above that of a mere indemnitor. Columbia

But, assuming the law of Pennsylvania to be that there is
an obligation on the part of these defendants, by reason of
their taking the deeds subject to the mortgage, to indemnify
the mortgagor on its covenant to insure, contained in the mort-
gage, what is the extent and character of that obligation thus
assumed? The covenant on the part of the mortgagor, which
we assume exists. by reasoni of the language contained in the
mortgage, was a personal obligation -or covenant. The ques-
tion then arises, what consequences would follow upon a breach
of the covenant by the mortgagor? Suppose it had not con-
veyed the property and still remained the owner and in posses-
sion, and yet refused or omitted to insure, as it had covenanted
to do in the mortgage, what remedy under this mortgage ex-
isted because of this violation by the mortgagor? The com-
plainant might have taken out insurance and claimed reim-
bursement or added the premiums paid to the amount of the
mortgage debt. It did not do so. What other remedy it had
for a violation of any covenant by the mortgagor is stated in
the mortgage. It is therein expressly understood and agreed
between the parties "that no other suit or proceeding for the
collection of the bonds shall be commenced, except such suits
or proceedings as shall be necessary to recover the possession
of the premises mortgaged, or to subject the same to the pay-
ment of the debts, and that the sale of the mortgaged premises,
whether under the power of sale granted or any other power
of sale, or by or under any judicial proceeding whatsoever,
shall operate as a full and com plete Satisfaction and discharge
of the j.ndebtedness of the mortgage and of the obligation of the
covenants therein contained, whether the premises should be
bidden in for the whole amount of the indebtedness or for a
less price, anything in the bonds or coupons to the contrary

Opinion of the Court.
thereof notwithstanding." The sale of the mortgaged prem-
ises is by the specific terms of the mortgage to operate as satis-
faction of all the covenants contained in the mortgage. And
in asking for the sale of the property, by the commencement
of this suit, complainant cannot add to the relief it is entitled
to by a sale, any other or different relief than that. By the
express provisions of the mortgage there was not only an ex-
emption of personal liability for the payment of the bonds and
coupons, or any part of them, but there was also an exemption
of all personal liability on account of the obligation of any
other covenant contained in the mortgage; such exemption
covering not only the obligation to pay the debt, but also any
other covenant. Hence the obligation to indemnify the mort-
gagor on account of any failure lay it to insure does not exist,
because there is no liability on the part of the mortgagor to
answer for its breach of covenant in any other way than by
complainant taking possession of the premises, or by a fore-
closure of the mortgage and sale thereunder. The mortgagor
having conveyed the premises, has no further interest in them,
and hence their sale under the mortgage would be no damage
to the mortgagor, and no case for indemnity to it would be
made out.
The alleged contractual obligation to indemnify, as well re-
garding the covenant to insure, as that regarding the payment
of the bonds and coupons, does not help the complainant in this
case, because of the affirmative provisions of the mortgage.
Whether the sale, under the foreclosure prayed for in this case,
has taken place or not, there is no other or personal liability of
the mortgagor to respond for its breach of covenant to insure
than that which it has provided for in the mortgage. If it be
under none other, then the indemnitor-has nothing to idein-
nify.
In regard to the contractual obligationi to insure on the part
of defendants, which complainant avers exists as one of the
foundations for the equitable lien claimed by it, the judge, de-
