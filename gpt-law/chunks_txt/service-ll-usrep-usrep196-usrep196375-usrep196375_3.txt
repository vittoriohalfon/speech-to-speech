owner thereof, and so are not purchased as articles of inter-
state commerce.
But if these purchases of live stock are interstate commerce,
the acts alleged in the sixth and seventh paragraphs are not
violations of the Sherman Act. Hopktns v United States, 171
U. S. 591, Anderson v United Slates, 171 U S. 604. They are
the exercise of a constitutional right of defendants to control
their own business.
There is nothing in the bill to show the proportion of the
entire number of head of live stock offered for sale at the mar-
kets in question, which is bought by the defendants for the
purposes of the production of fresh iieat, and so there is noth-
ing to show anything like monopoly or attempt at monopoly
of the live stock purchases by the defendants.
There is nothing in the bill to show any attempt on the part
of the defendants to control or affect the purchases or business
in the purchases of live stock of any other persons than them-
selves. The alleged combinations by defendants in the sixth
and seventh paragraphs charged have to do merely with their
own business conduct in themselves buying live stock, or de-
termining how much they shall buy, at private sale for con-
sumption in their own private business.
The combination charged in the sixth paragraph, for direct-
mg their respective purchasing agents "to refrain from bidding
against each other, except perfunctorily, and without good
faith," does not allege a combination to restrain trade, or even
a combnation to refrain from bidding. A perfunctory bid,
made without good faith, is one which the seller could accept
and enforce.
The alleged combination in the seventh paragraph, "for
bidding up, through their respective purchasing agents, the
prices of live stock for'a few days at a time at the said stock
yards and open markets," does not charge a combination to
restrain trade.
These alleged combinations do not have the direct and im-
mediate effect of restraining interstate commerce, but their

effect, if any, upon interstate trade in live stock is indirect and
incidental, within the meaning of the decisions of this court.
The effect is not near so direct or immediate as the mutual
agreement of the traders who were members of the Traders'
Exchange in the Anderson case.
Obviously the supply of live stock for fresh meat greatly
varies in the market at different seasons and times, while the
demand for fresh meats for human consumption, for which
defendants purchase such live stock, is comparatively constant
and uniform.
It is a public benefit and not a public evil that defendants
should always be able to supply such constant demand for their
fresh meats, and that at the same time they should not over-
stock the market with their perishable meats. This makes it
proper that they should act with some concert and conmmon
understanding in their purchases of live stock for that purpose.
As to the eighth paragraph we contend. The allegation of
combination and conspiracy is of a mere legal conclusion, and
insufficient. The sales of fresh meats by agents of defendants,
as there described, under the facts alleged, are not interstate
commerce. But if it be interstate commerce, no violation of
the Sherman Act is thereby shown.
No criminal conspiracy is alleged. The charge there is not
of a combination or conspiracy to restrain trade (which the
statute forbids), but is of a combination or conspiracy to do a
lawful act, the exercise of a constitutional right, viz: to raise,
'lower, fix and maintain their own prices, for their own prop-
erty, in private sales thereof by themselves. The doing that
is not prohibited or made criminal by the Act of Congress.
A criminal conspiracy is an agreement of two or more, either
to do an act criminal or unlawful in itself, or to do a lawful act
by means which are criminal or unlawfuil. Pettibone v United
States, 148 U S. 203, Commonwealth v Shedd, 7 Cush. 514.
Here neither the act nor the means alleged are criminal or un-
lawful. The allegation of intent is immaterial. Stevenson v
Newham, 13 C. B. 285, Allen v Flood, App. Cas. 1.

196 U. S. Argument for Appellants.
Again, this point is settled by the ruling in the Krnght Case,
156 U S. l,16,t hat the restraint of trade, if any, which a com-
bination by defendants to raise or lower their own prices would
tend to effect would be an indirect result, and such result would
not necessarily determine the object of the contract, combina-
tion or conspiracy
As to the ninth paragraph we contend. The allegation is of
a conclusion of law The cartage as there described is not,
under the allegations of the bill, interstate commerce. State v
Knght, 192 U S. 1, 21,Detroit& c. Ry. v Interstate Comm. Com.,
74 Fed. Rep. 803, 808, Hopkns v United States, 171 U S.
578, 592. The charge is not of a conspiracy either to (o a
criminal or unlawful act, or to do by unlawful means the law-
ful act of fixing their own charges for cartage. Nothing
here charged has the direct, immediate or necessary effect to
restrain interstate commerce.
As to the tenth paragraph we maintain. The allegation is of
a legal conclusion. It also is too indefinite and general. Suffi-
cient facts are not alleged. United States v Hanley, 71 Fed.
Rep. 672.
A contract or combination among manufacturers or pro-
ducers of an article which is intended to become the subject of
interstate commerce, to raise, lower and fix prices of such
article, is not necessarily a contract, combination or con-
spiracy in restraint of interstate trade or ai attempt to monop-
olize that trade under the Sherman Act. United States v
Nelson, 52 Fed. Rep. 646, In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104,
United States v E. C Knujht Co., 156 U S. 1, 16, Gibbs v
McNeeley, 102 Fed. Rep. 504. See also Distillery Co. v People,
156 Illinois, 468, Glucose Company v Hardng, 182 Illinois,
551.
There was no jurisdiction herein of this charge. No common
contract, combination or conspiracy of the defendants with
each other is alleged. The allegation that "all and each" have
made agreements for less than lawful transportation rates is
that they did so acting separately That was not unlawful on
