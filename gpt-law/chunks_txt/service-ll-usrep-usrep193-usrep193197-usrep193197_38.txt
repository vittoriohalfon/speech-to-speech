The Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway comi-
panies, competing interstate carriers, have been combined in
violation of section 1 of the Anti-Trust Act, that is to say, a
majority of the stock of each road has been transferred to a
common trustee, the Securities Company, which is thus vested
with the power to control and direct both roads for the common
benefit of the stockholders of each.
The Anti-Trust Act condemns in express terms every "coin-
bination in the form of trust," and if those companies have
been combined "in the form of trust," a violation of the very
letter of the statute has been proved.
There is no great difficulty in getting at what Congress
meant by a "trust." The meaning of the term was well
understood in the economic and industrial world at the tine
of the passage of the Anti-Trust Act, and is now. The word
was first used to describe an arrangement whereby the business
of several competing corporations is centralized and combined
by causing at least a majority of the stock of the constituent
corporations to be transferred to a trustee, who, in return,
issues to the stockholders "trust certificates." The trustee
holds the legal title to the shares and has the right to vote
them, and in this way exercises complete control over the

business of the combination. The trustee also receives the
dividends on the shares, and out of these pays the former
stockholders of the constituent corporations dividends on the
"trust certificates." See Century Dictionary; Am. & Eng.
Ency. Law, 2d ed., title Monopolies & Trusts; State v. Standard
Oil Co., 49 Ohio St. 137; Eddy on Combinations, § 582; Noyes
on Intercorp. Rel. § 304; Dodd's Pamphlet on Combi-
nations: Their Uses and Abuses. The facts show that the
Northern Securities Company constitutes a trust-it has all
the essential elements of one. It is a trustee, and as such
holds the stock of two competing companies; it has the legal
title, its stockholders have the equitable title, to the property.
Morawetz, § 237, and cases cited. There is a trust agreement,
the terms whereof are in the charter; it is sufficient to show an
agreement if the stockholders acted in pursuance of any under-
standing plan or scheme, verbal or otherwise. Harding v.
Am. Glucose Co., 182 Illinois, 551. The certificates of stock
of the company represent and fill the same office as trust
certificates; the company has the power to vote the stock
of both railways and thus elect the directors of both. As
trustee, it collects the dividends on the stock of both com-
panies and thereout pays dividends on its own stock exactly
as a trustee of a trust collects and pays on the trust certifi-
cates.
It constitutes a trust in another light also. As the courts
throughout the country held with practical unanimity that the
class of "trusts" just described is illegal, a second class was
invented of corporations that have acquired control of other
corporations by purchasing their stock. This organization is
of the same general character as the preceding, but the form
is changed in order to escape the force of the decisions of the
courts relating to corporate partnerships. Beach on Monop-
olies and Industrial Trusts, § 159. The Securities Company
clearly comes within this second classification of "trusts."

cose Case, supra.
It is not essential, however, to show that the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific Railway companies have been combined
in the technical form of "trust," or "corporate combination,"
as some writers call it when the trustee is a holding corpora-
tion. Section 1 of the Anti-Trust Act covers any and every
form of combination. A violation of that section will have
been established, therefore, if it is shown that-
Mr. Hill, Mr. Morgan, and the other individual defendants,
acting in concert or in pursuance of a previous understanding,
have caused the title to a majority of the shares of the Great
Northern and Northern Pacific companies to be vested in a
single person-the Securities Company-thereby centering the
control of the two roads in a single head and in that way effect-
ing a combination of them, the effect or tendency of which is
to suppress competition between them.
When analyzed the disguise by which the defendants sought
to hide the fact of the combination, and their connection there-
with, appears so thin and transparent that it is a cause of
wonder that they should ever have adopted such a flimsy
device.
It may succeed for a time in baffling persons who may
have an interest in preventing its being done and has suc-
ceeded, but it was a mere crafty contrivance to evade the
requisition of the law. Altorney-General v. The Great North-
ern Railway Company, 6 Jur. (N. S.) 1006; S. C., 1 Drew. &
Smale, 159.
The defendants seem to have thought that they could pro-
cure the organization of a corporation and have it do what
they could not lawfully do themselves or through the agency
of natural persons, as if that which would have been illegal
if done through the agency of a natural person would lose the
stamp of illegality if done through the agency of a corporate
organization; but see Attorney General v. Central R. Co.,
