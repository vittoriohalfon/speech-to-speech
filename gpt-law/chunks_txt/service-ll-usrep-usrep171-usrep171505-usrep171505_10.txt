Its effect will be, if it is successful, not to diminish, but to
increase transportation facilities, by.p reserving roads that
might otherwise be driven from the field.
IX. If the construction of the Anti-Trust act which was
adopted by the court in the Trans-issouric ase is to stand,
it is respectfully insisted that the act, so far as thus interpreted
and applied, is in violation of the provisions of the Constitu-
tion of the United States, since it deprives the defendants in
error of their liberty and their property without due process
of law, and deprives them likewise of the equal protection of
the laws.
This point was not made on the argument of the Trans-
Missouri case, because no such construction of the act was
anticipated by counsel. Nor was it considered by the court,
since it is an unvarying rule that no objection to the constitu-
tionality of a law. will be considered, unless raised by the party
affected.
The question thus presented is not.whether the act in gen-
eral, or in its application to the many other cases to which it
is obviously addressed, is unconstitutional, but -whether the
agreement here under consideration is one that may be pro-
hibited by legislation, without infringing the freedom of con-
tract and the right of property, which the Constitution declares
and protects.
In the Trans-.Missouri case, where the contract under con-
sideration was similar to the one here in controversy, though
far more open to the objections here urged, it was conceded,
both in the majority and the minority opinions of the court, that
its substantive character and purpose were such as the answers
in the case aver and set forth. It was for this reason believed
by the minority of the judges that it could not have been the
intention of Congress 'that such a contract should be made a
penal offence. But it was held by the majority that the lan-
guage of the act admitted of no other construction. Though
it was conceded in the opinion of the court that the arguments
against that conclusion "bear with much force upon the policy
of an act which should prevent a general agreement of rates
among competing railroad companies, to the extent simply

of maintaining those rates which were reasonable and fair."
And in the opinion of the minority of the court by Mr. Iustice
White, he remarks, after stating the general features of the
contract, "I content myself with giving this. mere outline of
the contract, and dQ not stop to demonstrate that its pro-
.visions are reasonable, since the opinion of the court rests
upon that hypothesis."
The accuracy of the statement we.have made above, of the
legal effect upon this case of the Anti-Trust act, as so construed,
is thus both established and conceded, and the question dis-
tinctly arises, whether legislation having such a result is within
the power o'f Congress.
That the operation of the act as thus interpreted does in
fact, by prohibiting the contract here in question, deprive the
defendants (whether righifully or not) of both liberty and
property to a very grave and perhaps ruinous extent, is not
open to question. A just freedom of contract in lawful busi-
ness is one of the most important rights reserved to the citizen
under the general term of "liberty," for all human industry
depends upon such freedom for its fair reward.
The use of property is an essential part of it, and when
abridged the property itself is taken. Its use is abridged when
the owner is precluded from any contract that is necessary
or desirable in order to secure to him a just compensation
for its employment. And when any class in the *community
is so precluded, it is to that extent "deprived of the equal
protection of the laws." These are elementary propositions in
constitutional law, and have been often asserted by this court.
In recapitulation of the points above presented upon the
question of the constitutionality of the Anti-Trust act, it it
is held applicable to the agreement in this case, we respectfully
insist: (1) That .the act deprives the defendants of both
liberty and property, by forbidding a contract just and rea-
sonable in itself, essential to the use of their property and
the prosecution of their business, and never before held or
claimed to be unlawful or wrong, and by which they only
agree to do what they have a right to do. That no such
contract can be prohibited by law without a violation of the

constitutional provision, whatever advantage to the public in
keeping down rates of transportation may be expected to result
from it. And that in attempting such a Prohibition, the case
contemplated by the Constitution is. distinctly presented, in
which the legislature deems that a public benefit is to be
effected by depriving the citizen of his liberty or property
without due process of law.
(2) That even if such a deprivation could be justified in any
case, t e public good in this case does not in any sense require
it, because (a) Those intended to be benefited are not the
public, but only one class -of the public who are seeking a
business advantage over another and much larger class, which
is equally entitled to protection. (b) Even if such class is held
to constitute the public, it is not entitled to the suppression
of all restriction upon competition. Because such a suppres-
sion would be a plain and oppressive violation of the equal
rights of the other class, inasmuch as it would compel the
latter to serve the former by labor and property-without just
compensation. (c) The legislation in question is not necessary,
even if it is admissible. The complete suppression of all the
restriction upon competition to which the public has a right
to object, is already effectually provided for by fall and careful
Congressional legislation, in which no defect or insufficiency
can be pointed out; so that the further suppression now pro-
posed only extelids to those restrictions, just and reasonable.
in themselves, to which the public have not a right to object.
And even without that or any legislation, it.would be utterly
impossible under existing facts, notorious and undisputed, for
railway companies to restrict'competition to a degree that
would result in ahy injury to the public. (d) That if all re-
strictions upon competition were prohibited, the result, instead
of a public advantage, would be a public calamity, and would
injure rather than benefit, the very class in whose behalf it
is contended for.
(3) That even if it were admitted that further legislation
against restrictions upon competition was both constitutional
and necessary, the provisions of this act, in forbidding all'such
restrictions, are not justly adapted to the only end that is
