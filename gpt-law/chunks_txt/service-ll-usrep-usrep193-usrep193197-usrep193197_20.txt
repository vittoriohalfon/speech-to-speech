direct effect, but would be merely indirect, remote, incidental,
and collateral, and aside from any intention of the parties, and
therefore would not bring said transactions within said act of
Congress. Any other construction would render the statute
unconstitutional as beyond the power of Congress, and as de-
priving these defendants and the sellers generally of the stock
thus sold, of liberty and property without due process of law,
because, thus construed, it would be an inhibition upon their
right to sell their property. If complainant's contention be
sustained, the right of the owner of property to sell the same
will be dependent upon what the courts at any future time may
hold to have been the intention of the purchaser in buying
such property. Such a result, would seriously impair the liberty
of the owner and the value of his property, and is contrary to
the constitutional guaranties thereof.
These transactions are, therefore, not within the act of Con-
gress above mentioned; nor has Congress any constitutional
power to annul or prohibit action thus expressly authorized by
state statutes under which the same has been taken.
XIX. There is a defect of necessary parties defendant herein
because in this suit it is sought to annul all sales of shares made
by shareholders of the Great Northern Company and the
Northern Pacific Company to the Northern Securities Company,
and to cancel all certificates of stock of the latter company
issued in purchase of the same. As already set forth, the par-
ties making such sales are numerous, and many of them had no
connection with the matter save to sell their shares in the rail-
way companies to the Securities Company after its organization.
It is obvious that in their absence no adjudication can be made
annulling such sales to the Securities Company. A decree to
such effect as prayed for by the petition necessarily would
deprive such original sellers of their property without due proc-
ess of law. All persons who sold shares in the railway corn-
panies to the Securities Company are, therefore, necessary
parties, and the petition is bad by reason of their absence.
XX. And these defendants deny all and all manner of

unlawful combination and confederacy wherewith they are by
the said petition charged, without this, that if there is any
other matter, cause, or thing in the petition contained material
or necessary for these defendants to make answer unto, and not
herein or hereby well and sufficiently answered, confessed,
traversed, and avoided or denied, the same is not true to the
knowledge or belief of these defendants; all of which matters
and things these defendants are ready and willing to aver, main-
tain, and prove as this honorable court shall direct, and humbly
pray to be hence dismissed with their reasonable costs and
charges in this behalf most wrongfully sustained.
The answer of the defendant Daniel S. Lamont was sub-
stantially the same as that of defendants Morgan and Bacon
except. that certain allegations as to the actions of J. P. Mor-
gan & Co. in Paragraphs XVI and XVII were omitted.
On April 9, 1903, after the case had been tried before a Cir-
cuit Court consisting of Circuit Judges Caldwell, Sanborn,
Thayer and Vandevanter (for opinion of Judge Thayer, see
120 Fed. Rep. 720), the following decree was entered:
"Ordered, adjudged and decreed as follows, to wit:
"That the defendants above named have heretofore entered
into a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and con-
merce among the several States, such as an act of Congress,
approved July 2, 1890, entitled 'An act to protect trade and
commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies' de-
nounces as illegal.
"That all the stocks of the Northern Pacific Railway Com-
pany and all the stock of the Great Northern Railway Com-
pany, now claimed to be owned and held by the defend-
ant, the Northern Securities Company, was acquired and is
now held by it in virtue of such combination or conspir-
acy in restraint of trade and commerce among the several
States.

supervision or influence whatsoever over the acts and (ldoings
of said railway companies or either of them by virtue of its
holding such stock therein.
"That the Northern Pacific Railway Company and the Great
Northern Railway Company, their officers, directors, servants
and agents be and they are hereby respectively and collectively
enjoined from permitting the stock aforesaid to be voted by
the Northern Securities Company, or in its behalf, by its at-
torneys or agents at any corporate election for directors or
officers of either of the aforesaid railway companies.
"And that they, together with their officers, directors, serv-
ants and agents, be likewise enjoined and respectively re-
strained from paying any dividends to the Northern Securities
Company on account of stock in either of the aforesaid railway
companies which it now claims to own and hold;
"And that the aforesaid railway companies, their officers,
directors, servants and agents, be enjoined from permitting or
suffering the Northern Securities Company or any of its offi-
cers or agents, as such officers or agents, to exercise any control
whatsoever over the corporate acts of either of the aforesaid
railway companies.
"But nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohib-
iting the Northern Securities Company from returning and
transferring to the Northern Pacific Railway Company and
the Great Northern Railway Company, respectively, any and
all shares of stock in either of said railway companies which
said, The Northern Securities Company, may have heretofore
received from such stockholders in exchange for its own stock;
and nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting
