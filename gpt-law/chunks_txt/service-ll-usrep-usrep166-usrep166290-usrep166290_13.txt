belonged to commerce. The difficulty in determining that
question, however, is no reason for denying effect to language
which, by its terms, plainly includes the transportation of
commodities among the several States or with foreign na-
tions, and which may also be the subject of contracts or
combinations in restraint of such commerce. The difficulty
of the subject, so far as the trade in or the manufacture of
commodities is concerned, arises from the limited control
which Congress has over the matter of trade or manufacture.
It was said by Mr. Justice Lamar in Kidd v. Pearson (supra):
"If it be held that the term" (commerce) "includes the regu-
lation of all such manufactures as are intended to be the sub-
ject of commercial transactions in the future, it is impossible
to deny that it would also include the productive industries
that contemplate the same thing. The result would be that
Congress would be invested, to the exclusion of the States,
with the power to regulate, not only manufactures, but also
agriculture, horticulture, stock raising, domestic fisheries and
mining -in short, every branch of human industry."
In the Knight Company case (sapra) it was said that this
statute applied to monopolies in restraint of interstate or inter-
national trade or commerce, and not to monopolies in the manu-
facture even of a necessary of life. It is readily seen from
these cases that if the act do not apply to the transportation
of commodities by railroads from one State to another or to
foreign nations, its application is so greatly limited that the
whole act might as well be held inoperative.
Still another ground for holding the act inapplicable is
urged, and that is that the language covers only contracts or
combinations like trusts or those which, while not exactly
trusts, are otherwise of the same form or nature. This is
clearly not so.
While the statute prohibits all combinations in the form of
trusts or otherwise, the limitation is not confined to that form
alone. All combinations which are in restraint of trade or
commerce are prohibited, whether in the form of trusts or in
any other form whatever.
We think, after a careful examination, that the statute

covers, and was intended to cover, common carriers by rail-
road.
Second. The next question to be discussed is as to what is
the true construction of the statute, assuming that it applies
to common carriers by railroad. What is the meaning of the
language as used in the statute, that "every contract, com-
bination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States or
with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal "? Is it
confined to a contract or combination which is only in un-
reasonable restraint of trade or commerce, or does it include
what the language of the act plainly and in terms covers, all
contracts of that nature ?
We are asked to regard the title of this act as indicative of
its purpose to include only those contracts which were un-
lawful at common law, but which require the sanction of a
Federal statute in order to be dealt with in a Federal court.
It is said that when terms which are known to the common
law are used in a Federal statute those terms are to be given
the same meaning that they received at common law, and
that when the language of the title is "to protect trade and
commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies," it
means those restraints and monopolies which the common law
regarded as unlawful, and which were to be prohibited by
the Federal statute. We are of opinion that the language
used in the title refers to and includes and was intended to
in*clude those restraints and monopolies which are made un-
lawful in the body of the statute. It is to the statute itself
that resort must be had to learn the meaning thereof, though
a resort to the title here creates no doubt about the meaning of
and does not alter the plain language contained in its text.
It is now with much amplification of argument urged that
the statute, in declaring illegal every combination in the form
of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or
commerce, does not mean what the language used therein
plainly imports, but that it only means to declare illegal any
such contract which is in unreasonable restraint of trade,
while leaving all others unaffected by the provisions of the

Act; that the common law meaning of the term "contract
in restraint of trade" includes only such contracts as are in
unreasonable restraint of trade, and when that term is used in
the Federal statute it is not intended to include all contracts
in restraint of trade, but only those which are in unreasonable
restraint thereof.
The term is not of such limited signification. Contracts in
restraint of trade have been known and spoken of for hundreds
of years both in England and in this country, and the term
includes all kinds of those contracts which in fact restrain or
may restrain trade. Some of such contracts have been held
void and unenforceable in the courts by reason of their
restraint being unreasonable, while others have been held
valid because they were not-of that nature. A contract may
be in restraint of trade and still be valid at common law.
Although valid, it is nevertheless a contract in restraint of
trade, and would be so described either at common law or
elsewhere. By the simple use of the term "contract in
restraint of trade," all contracts of that nature, whether valid
or otherwise, would be included, and not alone that kind of
contract which -was invalid and unenforceable as being in
unreasonable restraint of trade. When, therefore, the body
of an act pronounces as illegal every contract or combination
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States,
etc., the plain and ordinary meaning of such language is not
limited to that kind of contract alone which is in unreason-
able restraint of trade, but all contracts are included in such
language, and no exception or limitation can be added with-
out placing in the act that which has been omitted by
Congress.
Proceeding, however, upon the theory that the statute did
not mean what its plain language imported, and that it in-
tended in its prohibition to denounce as illegal only those
contracts which were in unreasonable restraint of trade, the
courts below have made an exhaustive investigation as to the
general rules which guide courts in declaring contracts to be
void as being in restraint of trade, and therefore against the
public policy of the country. In the course of their discussion
