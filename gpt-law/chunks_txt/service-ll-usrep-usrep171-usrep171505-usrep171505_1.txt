UNITED STATES v. JOINT TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.
No. 84. Argued February 24, 25, 1898. -5ecided October 24, 1898.
Thirty-one railroad companies, engaged in transportation between Chicago
and the Atlantic coast, formed themselves into an association known
as the Joint Traffic Association, by which they agreed that the associa-
tion should have jurisdiction over competitive traffic, except as noted,
passing through the western termini of the trunk lines and such other
points as might be thereafter designated, and to fix the rates, fares and
charges therefor, and from time to time change the same. No party to
the agreement was to be permitted to deviate from or change those rates,
fares or charges, and its action in that respect was not to affect rates
disapproved, except to the extent of its interest therein over its own road.
It was further agreed that the powers so conferred upon the managers
should le so construed and exercised as not to permit violation of the
Interstate Commerce Act, and that the managers should co6perate with
the Interstate Comnierce Commission to secure stability and uniformity
in rhtes, fares, charges, etc. The managers were given power to decide
and enforce the course which should be pursued with connecting com-
panies, not parties to the agreement, which declined or failed to observe the
established rates. Assessments were authorized in order to pay expenses,
and the agreement was to take effect January 1, 1896, and to continue in
existence for five years. The bill, filed on behalf of the United States,
sought a judgment declaring that agreement void. Held,
(1) That upon comparing this agreement with the one set forth in
United States v. Trans.Missouri lM'eiflt Association, 166 U. S. 290,
the similarity between them suggests that a similar result should
be reached in the two cases, as the point now taken was urged in
that case, and was then intentionally and necessarily decided;
(2) That so far as the establishment of rates and fares is concerned
there is no substantial difference between this agreement and the
one set forth in the Trans-Missouric ase ;
(3) That Congress, with regard to interstate commerce, and in the course
of regulating it in the case of railroad corporations, has the power
to say that no contract or combination- shall be legal, which shall
restrain trade and commerce, by shutting out the operation of the
general law of competition.
THE bill was filed in this case in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Southern District of New York for the
purpose of obtaining an adjudication that an agreement

entered into betWeen some thirty-one different railroad com-
panies was illegal, and enjoining its further execution.
These railroad companies formed most (but not all) of the
lines engaged in the business of railroad transportation be-
tween Chicago and the Atlantic coast, and the object of the
agreement, as expressed in its preamble, was to form an asso-
ciation of railroad companies "to aid in fulfilling the purpose
of the Interstate Commerce act, to co6perate with each other
and adjacent transportation associations to establish and main-
tain reasonable and just rates, fares, rules and regulations on
state and interstate traffic, to prevent unjust discrimination
and to secure the reduction and concentration of agencies and
the introduction of economies in the conduct of the freight
and passenger service." To accomplish these purposes the
railroad companies adopted articles of association, by which
they agreed that the affairs of the association should be admin-
istered by several different boards, and that it should have
jurisdiction over all competitive traffic (with certain exceptions
therein noted) which passed through the western termini of
the trunk lines (naming them), and such other points as might
be thereafter designated by the managers. The duly pub-
lished schedules of rates, fares and charges, and the rules
applicable thereto, which were in force at the time of the exe-
cution of the agreement and authorized by the different com-
panies and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission,
were reaffirmed by the companies composing the association.
From time to time the managers were to recommend such
changes in the rates, fares, charges and rules as might be
reasonable and just and necessary for governing the traffic
covered by the agreement and for protecting the interests of
the parties to the agreement, and a failure to observe such
recommendations by any of the parties to the agreement was to
be deemed a violation of the agreement. No company which
was a party to it was permitted in any way to deviate from
or to change the rates, fares, charges or rule- set forth in the
agreement or recommended-by the managers, except by a reso-
lution of the board of directors of the company, and its action
was not to affect the rates, etc., disapproved, except to the ex-

teat of its interest therein over its own road. A copy of such
resolution of the board of any company authorizing a change
of rates or fares, etc., was to be immediately forwarded by the
company making the same to the managers of the association,
and the change was not to become effective until thirty days
after the receipt of such resolution by the managers. Upon
the receipt of such resolution the managers were "to act
promptly upon the same for the protection of the parties
hereto." It was further stated in the -agreement that "the
powers conferred upon the managers shall be so construed and.
exercised as not to permit violation of the Interstate Com-
merce act, or any other law applicable to the premises or any
provision of the charters or the laws applicable to any of the
companies parties hereto, and the managers shall co6perate
with the Interstate Commerce Commission to secure stability
and uniformity in the rates, fares, charges and rules estab-
lished hereunder."
One provision of the agreement was to the effect that the
managers were charged with the duty of securing to each
company which was a party to the agreement equitable pro-
portions of the competitive traffic covered by the agreement,
so far as it could be legally done. The managers were given
power to decide and enforce the course which should be pur-
sued with connecting companies, not parties to the agreement,
which might decline or fail to observe the rates, etc., estab-
lished under it, and the interests of parties injuriously affected
by such action of the managers were to be accorded reason-
able prote~tion in so far as the managers could reasonably do
so. When in the judgment of the managers it was necessary
to the purposes of the agreement, they might determine the
divisions of rates and fares between copnecting companies who
were parties to the agreement and connections not parties
thereto, keeping in view uniformity and the equities involved.
Joint freight and passenger agencies might be organized by
the managers, and, if established, were to be so arranged as
to give proper representation to each company party to the
agreement. Soliciting or contracting passenger or freight
agencies were not to be maintained by the companies, except
