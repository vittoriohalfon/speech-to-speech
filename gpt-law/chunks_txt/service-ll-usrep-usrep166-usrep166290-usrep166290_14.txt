of that subject they have shown that there has been a grad-
ual though great alteration in the extent of the liberty granted
to the vendor of property in agreeing, as part consideration
for his sale, not to enter into the same kind of business for a
certain time or within a certain territory. So long as the sale
was the bonafide consideration for the promise and was not
made a mere excuse for an evasion of the rule itself, the later
authorities, both in England and in this country, exhibit a
strong tendency towards enabling the parties to make such a
contract in relation to the sale of property, including an agree-
ment not to enter into the same kind of business, as they may
think proper, and this with the view to granting to a vendor
the freest opportunity to obtain the largest consideration for
the sale of that which is his own. A contract which is the
mere accompaniment of the sale of property, and thus entered
into for the purpose of enhancing the price at which the ven-
dor sells it, which in effect is collateral to such sale, and where
the main purpose of the whole contract is accomplished by
such sale, might not be included, within the letter or spirit of
the statute in question. But we cannot see how the statute can
be limited, as it has been by the courts below, without reading
into its text an exception which alters the natural meaning of
the language used, and that, too, upon a most material point,
and where no sufficient reason is shown for believing that such
alteration would make the statute more in accord with the
intent of the law-making body that enacted it.
The great stress of the argument for the defendants on this
branch of the case has been to show if possible, some reason
in the attendant circumstances, or some fact existing in the
nature of railroad property and business upon which to found
the claim, that although by the language of the statute agree-
ments or combinations in restraint of trade or commerce are
included, the statute really means to declare illegal only those
contracts, etc., which are in unreasonable restraint of trade.
In order to do this the defendants call attention to many facts
which they have already referred to in their argument, upon
the point that railroads were not included at all in the statute.
They again draw attention to the fact of the peculiar nature of

railroad property. When a railroad is once built, it is said,
it must be kept in operation; it must transport property, when
necessary in order to keep its business, at the smallest price
and for the narrowest profit, or even for no profit, provided
running expenses can be paid, rather than not to do the work;
that railroad property cannot be altered for use for any other
purpose, at least without such loss as may fairly be called de-
structive; that competition while, perhaps, right and proper
in other business, simply leads in railroad business to financial
ruin and insolvency, and to the operation of the road by re-
ceivers in the interest of its creditors instead of in that of its
owners and the public; that a contest between a receiver of
an insolvent corporation and one which is still solvent tends
to ruin the latter company, while being of no benefit to the
former; that a receiver is only bound to pay operating ex-
penses, so he can compete with the solvent company and
oblige it to come down to prices incompatible with any profit
for the work done, and until ruin overtakes it to the destruc-
tion of innocent stockholders and the impairment of the public
interests.
To the question why competition should necessarily be con-
ducted to such an extent as to result in this relentless and
continued war, to eventuate only in the financial ruin of one
or all Qf the companies indulging in it, the answer is made
that if competing railroad companies be left subject to the
sway of free and unrestricted competition the results above
foreshadowed necessarily happen from the nature of the case;
that competition being the rule, each company will seek busi-
ness to the extent of its power, and will underbid its rival in
order to get the business, and such underbidding will act and
react upon each company until the prices are so reduced as to
make it impossible to prosper or live under them; that it is
too much to ask of hunan nature for one company to insist
upon charges sufficiently high to afford a reasonable compensa-
tion, and while doing so to see its patrons leave for rival roads
who are obtaining its business by offering less rates for doing
it than can be afforded and a fair profit obtained therefrom.
Sooner than experience ruin from mere inanition, efforts will

be made in the direction of meeting the underbidding of its
rival until both shall end in ruin. The only refuge, it is said,
from this wretched end lies in the power of competing roads
agreeing among themselves to keep up prices for transporta-
tion to such sums as shall be reasonable in themselves, so that
companies may be allowed to save themselves from themselves,
and to agree not to attack each other, but to keep up reason-
able and living rates for the services performed. It is said
that as railroads have a right to charge reasonable rates it
must follow that a contract among themselves to keep up
their charges to that extent is valid. Viewed in the light of
all these facts it is broadly and confidently asserted that it is
impossible to believe that Congress or any other intelligent
and honest legislative body could ever have intended to in-
clude all contracts or combinations in restraint of trade, and
as a consequence thereof to prohibit competing railways from
agreeing among themselves to keep up prices for transporta-
tion to such a rate as should be fair and reasonable.
These arguments it must be confessed bear with much force
upon the policy of an act which should prevent a general
agreement upon the question of rates among competing rail-
road companies to the extent simply of maintaining those
rates which were reasonable and fair.
There is another side to this question, however, and it may
not be amiss to refer to one or two facts which tend to some-
what modify and alter the light in which the subject should
be regarded. If only that kind of contract which is in unrea-
sonable restraint of trade be within the meaning of the statute,
and declared therein to be illegal, it is at once apparent that
the subject of what is a reasonable rate is attended with great
uncertainty. What is a proper standard by which to judge
the fact of reasonable rates? Must the rate be so high as to
enable the return, for the whole business done to amount to a
sum sufficient to afford the shareholder a fair and reasonable
profit upon his investment? If so, what is a fair and reason-
able profit? That depends sometimes upon the risk incurred,
and the rate itself differs in different localities: which is the
one to which reference is to be made as the standard? Or is
