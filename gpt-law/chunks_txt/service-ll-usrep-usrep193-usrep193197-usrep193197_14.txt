view of the injury apprehended to both companies, and to their
shareholders, and the better to protect their interests in the
future, the Great Northern shareholders holding Northern
Pacific shares, deemed it advisable that the projected holding
company should have power to purchase not only their own
Great Northern and Northern Pacific shares, but. also the shares
of such other Great Northern and Northern Pacific shareholders
as might wish to sell their stock to said holding company, and
the shares of companies already formed, and others that might,
be formed, for the purpose of aiding the traffic or operations of
the Great Northern and Northern Pacific companies, respec-
tively. At this time it was not expected by any of the persons
concerned that any Northern Pacific shares except the said
forty-two million dollars (842,000,000) would be acquired
by the proposed holding company. The organization of such
company was not dependent on any agreement, that it should
acquire a majority of the shares of either defendant railway
company. It would have been organized if the Burlington pur-
chase had not been made, and if its promoters had had no other
shares to transfer to it than the thirty-four million dollars
($34,000,000) Great Northern stock and the twenty million
dollars (820,000,000) Northern Pacific stock held by them on
May 1, 1901. It was not known that all or how many of the
shareholders of either of the railway companies would be ]ike]y
to transfer their shares to this defendant when formed. After
its organization this defendant bought and still holds about one
hundred and fifty million dollars (8150,000,000) of the stock of
the Northern Pacific Company; and it has also purchased and
negotiated for the purchase of the stock of the Great Northern
Company, as hereinbefore stated. Neither the said persons
who were concerned in the formation of this defendant, nor the
said persons from whom it has acquired the stocks of said rail-
way companies, nor this defendant itself since its formation, nor
its stocldolders, directors, or officers, have planned or intended
that the stock of said railway companies acquired by this de-
fendant, or any part thereof, should be held, used, or voted by

it, or by its officers, agents or proxies, for the purpose of com-
bining, consolidating or placing under one common manage-
ment or control the railways of the Great Northern and North-
ern Pacific companies, or the business thereof; or for the purpose
of monopolizing or restraining competition between the said
railway companies; or for any other purpose than the election
by each of said railway companies of a competent and distinct
board of directors, able and intending to manage each of them
independently of the other, and for the benefit of their share-
holders and of the public. By the acts of the legislature of the
State of Minnesota incorporating the Great Northern Railway
Company, and by the acts of the legislature of the State of
Wisconsin incorporating the Northern Pacific Railway Com-
pany, it is, in substance, provided that the business and affairs
of each railway company shall be managed by a board of di-
rectors to be elected by the stockholders, and that all the
powers of each corporation relating to said matters shall be
vested in such board.
Every share of sfock issued by this defendant has been issued
to the persons and corporations receiving the same in good faith,
for full value paid to it, either in cash or its equivalent, and in
accordance with the provisions of its articles of incorporation
and with the laws of the State of New Jersey. No agreement,
promise, or understanding has been made between this defend-
ant and any of its stockholders, or between its stockholders
themselves or any of them, or between said stockholders or any
other persons or corporations, that the stock of this defendant
should be held, used, or voted other than by each stockholder,
separately and individually, and in such way as he should see
fit; and there has been no agreement, promise, or understanding
between said stockholders themselves, or any of them, or be-
tween said stockholders and any other person or corporation,
that they or any of them should use, hold, or vote their stock in
this defendant in association or for any common purpose or
object. The owners and holders of stock of this defendant are
more than thirteen hundred (1,00) in number, and the owner-

ship of the stock is being changed from day to day by sales
and transfers in the usual course of dealing. The said persons
who formed or were otherwise concerned in the formation of
this defendant have never, all together, held, owned or other-
wise controlled an amount of stock of the said company equal to
so much as one-third of the whole amount thereof now out-
standing. This defendant has no contract or obligation to pur-
chase or acquire any shares whatever in either railway conpany,
in addition to those which it has purchased or negotiated to pur-
chase, as above stated. Its authorized capital was fixed by per-
sons who planned its organization to enable it to give to each
stockholder in each of the defendant railway companies an op-
portunity to sell his stock to it, should he see fit, to do so, and
should this defendant desire to acquire it. The sum fixed was
deemed ample by those who planned the formation of this
defendant to furnish the means to pay for all such shares as
would likely be acquired by it, and to leave remaining a large
amount to be used for the purchase of stock in other corpora-
tions, not common carriers, which this defendant might con-
sider beneficial to acquire. This defendant was not formed as
a scheme or a device to evade the act of Congress known as the
"Anti-Trust Act, " or any other law whatever, but solely for
the purposes hereinbefore stated.
III. This defendant was not formed, nor did any of those con-
cerned in its formation, nor any of those who sold their shares
of stock to it, have any purpose or intention, to restrain tradIe
or commerce, or to lessen competition between said railway
companies, or to monopolize traffic in any manner whatever;
nor can any such results follow from the formation or operation
of this defendant. In point of fact, since the organization of
this defendant rates on the defendant railway companies' lines,
including rates to and from points common to both, have vol-
untarily been so reduced as to decrease their earnings by
upwards of a million of dollars annually. For all interstate
commerce on the lines of either the defendant railway com-
panies, except traffic beginningoand ending on their own lines
