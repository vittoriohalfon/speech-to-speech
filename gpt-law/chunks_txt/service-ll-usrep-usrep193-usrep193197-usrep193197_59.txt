NORTHERN SECURITIES CO. v. UNITED STATES. 371
193 U. S. WHITE, J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, PECKHAM, HOLMES, JJ., dissenting.
In the argument at bar many of the consequences above
indicated as necessarily resulting from the contention made
were frankly admitted, since it was conceded that, even al-
though the holding of the stock in the two railroads by the
Northern Securities Company which is here assailed, was
expressly authorized by the laws of both the States by which
the railroad corporations were created, as it was by the law
of the State of New Jersey, nevertheless as such authority, if
exerted by the States, would be a regulation of interstate com-
merce, it would be repugnant to the Constitution as an attempt
on the part of the States to interfere with the paramount au-
thority of Congress on that subject. True, this assertion, made
in the oral argument, in the printed argument is qualified by
an intimation that the rule would not apply to state action
taken before the adoption of the Anti-Trust Act, since up to
that time, in consequence of the inaction of Congress on the
subject, the States were free to legislate as they pleased regard-
ing the matter. But this suggestion is without foundation
to rest on. It has long since beon determined by this court
that where a particular subject matter is national in its char-
acter and requires uniform regulation, the absence of legislation
by Congress on the subject indicates the will of Congress that
the subject should be free from state control. County of
Mobile v. Kimball, 102 U. S. 691; Robbins v. Shelby Taxing
District, 120 U. S. 489, 493; United States v. E. C. Knight Com-
pany, 156 U. S. 1.
It is said, moreover, that the decision of this case does not
involve the consequences above pointed out, since the only
issue in this case is the right of the Northern Securities Com-
pany to acquire and own the stock. The right of that company
to do so, it is argued, is one thing; the power of individuals or
corporations, when not merely organized to hold stock, an
entirely different thing. My mind fails to seize the distinction.
The only premise by which the power of Congress can be ex-
tended to the subject matter of the right of the Securities
Company to own the stock miust be the proposition that sueh

ownership is within the legislative power of Congress, -nd if
that proposition be admitted it is not perceived by what
process of reasoning the power of Congress over the subject
matter of ownership is to be limited to ownership by particular
classes of corporations or persons. If the power emlraces
ownership, then the authority of Congress over all ownership
which in its judgment may affect interstate commerce neces-
sarily exists. In other words, the logical result of the asserted
distinction amounts to one of two things. Either that nothing
is decided or that a decree is to be entered having no foundation
upon which to rest. This is said because if the control of the
ownership of stock in competing roads by one and the same
corporation is within the power of Congress, and creates a
restraint of trade or monopoly forbidden by Congress, it is not
conceivable to me how exactly similar ownership by one or
more individuals would not create the same restraint or mo-
nopoly, and be equally within the prohibition which it is decided
Congress has imposed. Besides the incongruity of the con-
clusion resulting from the alleged distinction, to admit it would
do violence to both the letter and spirit of the Constitution,
since it would in effect hold that, although a particular act was
a burden upon interstate commerce or a monopoly thereof,
individuals could lawfully do the act, provided only they
did not use the instrumentality of a corporation. But this
court long since declared that the power to regulate commerce,
conferred upon Congress, was "general and includes alike
commerce by individuals, partnerships, associations and cor-
porations." Pau v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 183.
Indeed, the natural reluctance of the mind to follow an
erroneous principle to its necessary conclusion, and thus to
give effect to a grievous wrong arising from the erroneous
principle, is an admonition that the principle itself is wrong.
That admonition, I submit, is conclusively afforded by the
decree which is now affirmed. Without stopping to point out
what seems to me to be the confusion, contradiction and denial
of rights of property which the decree exemplifies, let me see

if in effect it is not at war with itself and in conflict with the
principle upon which it is assumed to be based.
Fundamentally considered, the evil sought to be remedied
is the restraint of interstate commerce and the monopoly
thereof, alleged to have been brought about, through the
acquisition by Mr. Morgan and.Mr. Hill and their friends and
associates, of a controlling interest in the stock of both the
roads. And yet the decree, whilst forbidding the use of the
stock by the Northern Securities Company, authorizes its
return to the alleged conspirators, and does not restrain them
from exercising the control resulting from the ownership. If
the conspiracy and combination existed and was illegal, my
mind fails to perceive why it should be left to produce its full
force and effect in the hands of the individuals by whom it was
charged the conspiracy was entered into.
It may, however, be said that even if the results which I
have indicated be held necessarily to arise from the principles
contended for by the government, it does not follow that such
power would ever be exerted by Congress, or, if exerted, would
be enforced to the detriment of charters granted by the States
to railroads or consolidations thereof, effected under state
authority, or the ownership of stock in such railroads by in-
dividials, or the rights of individuals to acquire property by
purchase, lease or otherwise, and to make any and all contracts
concerning property which may thereafter become the subject
matter of interstate commerce. The first suggestion is at
once met by the consideration that it has been decided by
this court that, as the Anti-Trust Act forbids any restraint,
it therefore embraces even reasonable contracts or agreements.
If, then, the ownership of the stock of the two railroads by the
Northern Securities Company is repugnant to the act it follows
that ownership, whether by the individual or another corpo-
ration, would be equally within the prohibitions of the act.
As to the second, true it is that by the terms of the Anti-Trust
Act the power to put its provisions in motion is, as to many
particulars, confided to the highest law officer of the govern-
