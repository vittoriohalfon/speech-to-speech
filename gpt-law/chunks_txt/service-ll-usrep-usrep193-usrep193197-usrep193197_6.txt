represent and cover the exchange value of substantially the
entire stock of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Rail-
way companies, upon the basis and at the rate agreed upon,
which is about $122,000,000 in excess of the combined capital
stock of the two railway companies taken at par.
XII. If the Government fails to prevent the carrying out, of
the combination or conspiracy aforesaid, and the defendant, the
Northern Securities Company, is permitted to receive and hold
and act as owner of the stock of the Northern Pacific and Great,
Northern Railway companies as aforesaid, not only will a vir-
tual consolidation of two competing transcontinental lines, with
the practical pooling of their earnings, be effected, and a
monopoly of the interstate and foreign commerce formerly
carried on by them as competitors be created, and all effective
competition between such lines in the carrying of interstate and
foreign traffic be destroyed, but thereafter, to all desiring to use
it, an available method will be presented, whereby, through the
corporate scheme or device aforesaid, the act of Congress of
July 2, 1890, entitled "An act to protect trade and commerce
against unlawful restraints and monopolies," may be circum-
vented and set at naught, and all transcontinental lines, indeed
the entire railway systems of the country, may be absorbed,
merged, and consolidated, thus placing the public at the abso-
lute mercy of the holding corporation.
XII-I. In furtherance of the purpose and object of the unlaw-
ful combination or conspiracy aforesaid to monopolize or at-
tempt to monopolize the trade or commerce among the several
States, and between such States and foreign countries, formerly
carried on in free competition by the defendants, the Northern
Pacific and Great Northern Railway companies, and to place a
restraint thereon, the individual defendants named and their
associate stockholders of the defendant railway companies,
have combined or conspired with one another and with other
persons (whose names are unknown to the complainant, but
whom it prays to have made parties to this action when ascer-
tained) to use and employ, in addition to the corporate scheme

or device aforesaid, and in aid thereof, various other schemes,
devices, and instrumentalities, the precise details of which are
at present unknown to the complainant but will be laid before
the court when ascertained, by means of which, unless pre-
vented by the order of this court, the object and purpose of the
unlawful combination or conspiracy aforesaid may and will be
accomplished.
PRAYER.
In consideration whereof, and inasmuch as adequate relief in
the premises can only be obtained in this court, the United
States of America prays your honors to order, adjudge, and
decree that the combination or conspiracy hereinbefore de-
scribed is unlawful, and that all acts done or to be done in carry-
ing it out are in derogation of the common rights of all the peo-
ple of the United States and in violation of the act of Congress of
July 2, 1890, entitled "An act to protect trade and commerce
against unlawful restraints and monopolies," and that the
defendants and each and every one of them, and their officers,
directors, stockholders, agents, and servants, and each and
every one of them, be perpetually enjoined from doing any act
in pursuance of or for the purpose of carrying out the same,
and, in addition, that the several defendants be respectively
