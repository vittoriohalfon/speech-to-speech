I1idd v Pealrson,1 28 U. S. 1, was cited m argument as sup-
porting that view In that case the sole question was,
whether the State of Iowa could forbid the manufacture
within its limits of ardent spirits intended for sale ultimately
in other States. This court held that the manufacture of
intoxicating liquors in a State is none the less a business within
the State subject to state control because the manufacturer
may intend, at his convenience, to export such liquors to
foreign countries or to other States. The authority of the
States over the manufacture of strong drinks within their
respective jurisdictions was referred to their plenary power,
never surrendered to the national government, of providing
for the health, morals, and safety of their people.
That case presented no question as to a comnilnatwmo to
monopolize the sale of ardent spirits manufactured in Iowa to
be sold in other States -no question as to combinations in
restraint of trade as involved in the buying and selling of
articles that are intended to go, and do go, and will always
go, into commerce throughout the entire country, and are
used by the people of all the States, and the making or manu-
facturing of which no State could forbid consistently with the
liberty that every one has of pursuing, without undue restric-
tions, the ordinary callings of life. There is no dispute here
as to the lawfulness of the business of refining sugar, apart
front the undue restraintw hich the promoters of such bustness,
who have cornbmed to controlp rwes, seek to put upon the free-
domn of tnterstate traffic iq that artwle.
It may be admitted that an act which did nothing more
than forbid, and which had no other object than to forbid, the
mere refining of sugar in any State, would be in excess of any
power granted to Congress. But the act of 1890 is not of
that character. It does not strike at the manufacture simply
of articles that are legitimate or recognized subjects of com-
merce, but at combinations that unduly restrain, because they
monopolize, the buying and selling of articles which are to go
into interstate commerce. In State v Stewart, 59 Vermont,
273, 286, it was said that if a combination of persons "seek to
restrain trade, or tend to the destruction of the material prop-

erty of the country, they work injury to the whole people."
And in State v Glidden, 55 Connecticut, 46, 75, the court said
"Any one man, or any one of several men acting independently,
is powerless, but when several combine and direct their united
energies to the accomplishment of a bad purpose, the combina-
tion is formidable. Its power for evil increases as its numbers
increase. The combination becomes dangerous and
subversive of the rights of others, and the law wisely says
it is a crime." Chief Justice Gibson well said in Com.
monwealth v Carlisle, Brightly, (Penn.,) 36, 41 "There is
between the different parts of the body politic a reciprocity
of action on each other, which, like the action of antagonizing
muscles in the natural body, not only prescribes to each its
appropriate state and action, but regulates the motion of the
whole. The effort of an individual to disturb this equilibrium
can never be perceptible, nor carry the operation of his interest
or that of any other individual beyond the limits of fair com-
petition, but the increase of power by combination of means,
being in geometrical proportion to the number concerned, an
association may be able to give an impulse, not only oppressive
to individuals, but mischievous to the public at large, and it
is the employment of an engine so powerful and dangerous
that gives criminality to an act that would be perfectly
innocent, at least in a legal view, when done by an individual."
These principles underlie the act of Congress, which has for
its sole object the protection of such trade and commerce as
the Consttution, confides to naftonal control, and the question
is presented whether the combmation assailed by this suit is
an unlawful restraint upon interstate trade in a necessary
article of food which, as every one knows, has always entered,
now enters and must continue to enter, in vast quantities, into
commerce among the States.
In .idd v Pearson we recognized, as had been done in pre-
vious cases, the distinction between the mere transportation
of articles of interstate commerce and the purchaszng and
selling thatyrecede tr-ansportation. It is said that manufacture
precedes commerce and is not a part of it. But it is equally
true that when manufacture ends, that wnch has been manu-

factured becomes a subject of commerce, that buying and
selling succeed manufacture, come into existence after the
process of manufacture is completed, precede transportation,
and are as much commercial intercourse, where articles are
bought to be carried from one State to another, as is the
manual transportation of such articles after they have been
so purchased. The distinction was recognized by this court
in Gibbons v Ogden, where the principal question was whether
commerce included navigation. Both the court and counsel
recognized buying and selling or barter as ncluded =
commerce. Chief Justice Marshall said that the mind can
scarcely conceive a system for regulating commerce, which
was "confined to prescribing rules for the conduct of indi-
viduals in the actual employment of buying and selling, or of
barter." pp. 189, 190.
The power of Congress covers and protects the absolute
freedom of such intercourse and trade among the States as
may or must succeed manufacture and precede transportation
from the place of purchase. This would seem to be conceded,
for, the court in the present case expressly declare that "con-
tracts to buy, sell, or exchange goods to be tranmsorted among
the several States, the transportation and its instrumentalities,
and articles bought, sold, or exchanged for the purpose of
such transit among the States, or put in the way of transit,
may be regulated, but this is because they form part of snter-
state trade or commerce." Here is a direct admission - one
which the settled doctrines of this court justify - that con-
tracts to buy and the purchasing of goods to be tran&ported
from one State to another, and transportation, with its instru-
mentalities, are all _parts of interstate trade or commerce.
Each part of such trade is then under the protection of Con-
gress. And yet, by the opinion and judgment in this case, if
I do not misapprehend them, Congress is without power to
protect the commercial intercourse that such purchasing neces-
sarily involves against the restraints and burdens arising from
the existence of combtnations that meet purchasers, from what-
ever State they come, with the threat - for it is nothing more
nor less than a threat - that they shall not purchase what
