will be best subserved when the natural laws of competition
are left undisturbed by those engaged in interstate comnerce,
and as Congress has embodied that rule in a statute, that
must be, for all, the end of the matter, if this is to remain a
government of laws, and not of men.
It is said that railroad corporations created under the laws
of a State can only be consolidated with the authority of the
State. Why that suggestion is made in this case we cannot
understand, for there is no pretense that the combination here
in question was under the authority of the States under whose
laws these railroad corporations were created. But even if
the State allowed consolidation it would not follow that the
stockholders of two or more state railroad corporations, having
competing lines and engaged in interstate commerce, could l'aw-
fully combine and form a distinct corporation to hold the
stock of the constituent corporations, and, by destroying coi-
petition between them, in violation of the act of Congress,
restrain commerce among the States and with foreign nations.
The rule of competition, prescribed by Congress, was not
at all new in trade and commerce. And we cannot be in any
doubt as to the reason that moved Congress to the incorpora-
tion of that rule into a statute. That reason was thus stated
in United States v. Joint Traffic Association: "Ilas not 0on-
gress with regard to interstate commerce and in the course
of regulating it, in the case of railroad corporations, the power
to say that no contract or combination shall be legal which
shall restrain trade and commerce by shutting out the operation
of the general law of competition? We think it has.
It is the combination of these large and powerful corpora-
tions, covering vast sections of territory and influencing trade
throughout the whole extent thereof, and acting as one body
in all the matters over which the combination extends, that
constitutes the alleged evil, and in regard to which, so jar as the
combination operates upon and restrains interstate commerce,
Congress has power to legislate and to prohibit." (pp. 569,
571.) That such a rule was applied to interstate commerce

should not have surprised any one. Indeed, when Congress
declared contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint
of trade or commerce to be illegal, it did nothing more than
apply to interstate commerce a rule that had been long ap-
plied by the several States when dealing with combinations
that were in restraint of their domestic commerce. The deci-
sions in state courts upon this general subject are not only nu-
merous and instructive but they show the circumstances under
which the Anti-Trust Act was passed. It may well be assumed
that Congress, when enacting that statute, shared the general
apprehension that a few powerful corporations or combina-
tions sought to obtain, and, unless restrained, would obtain
such absolute control of the entire trade and commerce of the
country as would be detrimental to the general welfare.
In Morris Run Coal Co. v. Barclay Coal Co., 68 Pa. St.
173, 186, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania dealt with a
combination of coal companies seeking the control within a
large territory of the entire market for bituminous coal. The
court, observing that the combination was wide in its scope,
general in its influence, and injurious in its 'effects, said:
"When competition is left free, individual error or folly will
generally find a correction in the conduct of others. But
here is a combination of all the companies operating in the
Blossburg and Barclay mining regions, and controlling their
entire productions. They have combined together to govern
the supply and the price of coal in all the markets from the
Hudson to the Mississippi rivers, and from Pennsylvania to
the Lakes. This combination has a power in its confederated
form which no individual action can confer. The public in-
terest must succumb to it, for it has left no competition free
to correct its baleful influence. When the supply of coal is
suspended the demand for it becomes importunate, and prices
must rise. â€¢O r if the supply goes forward, the prices fixed by
the confederates, must accompany it. The domestic hearth,
the furnaces of the iron master and the fires of the manufac-
turer all feel the restraint, while many dependent hands are

paralyzed and hungry mouths are stinted. The influence of
a lack of supply or a rise in the price of an article of such
prime necessity cannot be measured. It permeates the entire
mass of the community, and leaves few of its members un-
touched by its withering blight. Such a combination is more
than a contract; it is an offense. . In all such combina-
tions where the purpose is injurious or unlawful, the gist of
the offense is the conspiracy. Men can often do by the com-
bination of many what severally no one could accomplish, and
even what when (lone by one would be innocent.
There is a potency in numbers when combined, which the law
cannot overlook, where injury is the consequence." The same
principles were applied in Arnot v. Pittston & Elmira Cool Co.,
68 N. Y. 558, 565, which was the case of a combination of
two coal companies, in order to give one of them a Inonop-
oly of coal in a particular region, the Court of Appeals of
New York holding that "a combination to effect such a purpose
is inimical to the interests of the public, and that all contracts
designed to effect such an end are contrary to public policy,
and therefore illegal." They were also applied by the Su-
preme Court of Ohio in Central Ohio Salt Co. v. Guthric, 35
Ohio St. 666, 672, which was the case of a combination among
manufacturers of salt in a large salt-producing territory, the
court saying: "It is no answer to say that competition in the
salt trade was not in fact destroyed, or that the price of the
commodity was not unreasonably advanced. Courts will not
stop to enquire as to the degree of injury inflicted upon the public;
it is enough to know that the inevitable tendency of such contracts
is injurious to the public."
So, in Craft v. McConoughy, 79 Illinois, 346, 350, which was
the case of a combination among grain dealers by which com-
petition was stifled, the court saying: "So long as competition
was free, the interest of the public was safe. The laws of trade,
in connection with the rigor of competition, was all the guar-
anty the public required, but the secret combiwation created by
the contract destroyed all competition and created a monopoly
