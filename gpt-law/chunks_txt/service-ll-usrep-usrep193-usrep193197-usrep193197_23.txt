193 U. S. Argument of Mr. Young for Appellants.
2. Being a criminal statute, the act is not to be enlarged by
construction. The first section cannot be stretched so as to
make criminal (and whatever the section declares unlawful, it
makes criminal, and makes nothing criminal it has not declared
unlawful) every agreement, combination or conspiracy that
merely tends to restrain commerce among the States, or that
confers on the parties to it or any one else the power to re-
strain trade.
3. The act makes unlawful and criminal every contract,
combination or conspiracy in direct restraint of interstate
trade or commerce.
The gist of the crime is the contract, combination or con-
spiracy, and the offense is complete on the making of such con-
tract, or the formation of such combination or conspiracy,
though nothing be done to carry it out, and though trade be
not in fact restrained.
But to constitute a combination or conspiracy in restraint of
interstate trade or commerce, the parties must combine or con-
spire to do acts, which, if performed, will of themselves restrain
such trade or commerce, and will directly restrain it-that is,
acts which operate directly on such commerce.
If the acts which the parties combine or conspire to do fall
short of this, if they are not such as operate directly on the
commerce, and by such operation directly restrain it, then the
combination or conspiracy is not within the act.
4. The act makes criminal those contracts, combinations and
conspiracies only which directly and immediately restrain in-
terstate trade or commerce-that is by acting directly and
immediately upon such trade or commerce. 171 U. S. 568,
592; 175 U. S. 234, 245.
5. As the crime consists in contracting, combining or con-
spiring to do acts which by their own operation will directly
and immediately restrain interstate commerce, it necessarily
follows that if the acts which the parties contract or combine to
do are of that description, they violate the law, though they had
no conscious purpose or "specific intent" to restrain interstate

commerce by the means of such acts or at all. 156 U. S.
341.
On the other hand, if the acts to be done are not such as by
their own operation on interstate commerce directly restrain it.
the contract, combination or conspiracy to do those acts is not
a crime under the Anti-Trust Act. 175 U. S. 234.
6. The act makes criminal every contract, etc., in direct
restraint of commerce, without respect of persons.
A contract or combination or conspiracy that would be crim-
inal as in restraint of interstate commerce or trade if made be-
tween two or more railway companies, is equally a crime if made
between two or more interstate carriers by wagon or stage-
coach or ferry, or between two or more interstate traders
wholesale or retail. 166 U. S. 312.
7. Any restraint of interstate commerce, or power to restrain
it, directly consequent upon the acquisition of property anl in-
cident to its ownership, is not, nor is the agreement for such
acquisition made criminal by, this act. 156 U. S. 16.
Hence, where competitors in interstate trade or commerce
agree to and do form a partnership or a corporation, or where
one of them buys out the other, or a third person or association
of persons buys out both, whatever suppression of competition
or power to suppress competition may follow is not, nor is the
agreement to form such corporation, partnership or associa-
tion for such purchase, made criminal by the act. 171 U. S.
505, 567.
8. So where a combination is formed to acquire, and which
does acquire, nearly all of an article in common use through-
out the country and shipped in large quantities among the
States, such ownership, though it gives the power to control
the interstate trade and commerce in such article, and to sup-
press such trade and commerce altogether, is not, nor is such
combination, a restraint of commerce prohibited by the Anti-
Trust Act, the power being an incident of ownership. 156
U. S. 1, 16.
9. By this act Congress regulates commerce by punishing

the making of certain contracts by fine and imprisonment.
The regulation is and must be uniform throughout the United
States, for an act made criminal when done in Minnesota can-
not be innocent when done in Massachusetts. The matters
embraced in the act, thus requiring a uniform regulation
throughout the country, are matters within the exclusive ju-
risdiction of Congress, and no matters that are not within such
exclusive jurisdiction are within the act. If it appears that
the States have jurisdiction of any matter (e. g., the ownership
of stock in or the consolidation of railway companies doing
an interstate business) claimed to be within this act, the ex-
istence of jurisdiction in the States is conclusive that such
matter is not within the act.
The appellants, therefore, maintain the following proposi-
tions:
1. The Government is not entitled to maintain this proceed-
ing under sections 1 and 4 of the Anti-Trust Act, nor had the
Circuit Court jurisdiction of it under those sections, for the
conspiracy or combination charged in the petition and found
by the Circuit Court, if it ever existed, had done all it was
formed to do, and had come to an end, before the proceeding
was instituted.
2. The only combination of which there is any evidence is
a combination formed in aid of commerce, to liberate, protect
and enlarge and not to restrain it, and which has liberated,
protected, aided and enlarged it, and has not restrained and
does not threaten to restrain it.
3. There is no evidence of the combination or conspiracy
charged in the petition, or of the combination or conspiracy
found by the Circuit Court.
4. The conspiracy or combination in question whether as
alleged in the petition or 4s found by the Circuit Court, was
not a combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate com-
merce, for the only things which the parties thereto combined
or conspired to do or procure to be done were (1) the organiza-
tion of the Securities Co., and (2) the acquisition by the Se-
