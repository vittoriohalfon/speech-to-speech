Bill in Equity. 193 U. S.
and between said States and foreign countries carried on by
the Northern Pacific and Great Northern systems, and con-
triving and intending unlawfully to monopolize or attempt to
monopolize such trade or commerce, and contriving and intend-
ing unlawfully to restrain and prevent competition among said
railway systems in respect to such interstate and foreign trade or
commerce, and contriving and intending unlawfully to deprive
the public of the facilities and advantages in the carrying on of
such interstate and foreign trade or commerce theretofore en-
joyed through the independent competition of said railway sys-
tems, entered into an unlawful combination or conspiracy to
effect a virtual consolidation of the Northern Pacific and Great
Northerrr systems, and to place restraint upon all competitive
interstate and foreign trade or commerce carried on by them,
and to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the same, and to
suppress the competition theretofore existing between said rail-
way systems in said interstate and foreign trade or commerce,
through the instrumentality and by the means following, to wit:
A holding corporation, to be called the Northern Securities
Company, was to be formed under the laws of New Jersey, with
a capital stock of $400,000,000, to which, in exchange for its
own capital stock upon a certain basis and at a certain rate, was
to be turned over and transferred the capital stock, or a con-
trolling interest in the capital stock, of each of the defendant
railway companies, with power in the holding corporation to
vote such stock and in all respects to act as the owner thereof,
and to do whatever it might deem necessary to aid in any
manner such railway companies or enhance the value of their
stocks. In this manner, the individual stockholders of these
two independent and competing railway companies were to be
eliminated and a single common stockholder, the Northern
Securities Company, was to be substituted; the interest of the
individual stockholders in the property and franchises of the.
two railway companies was to terminate, being thus converted
into an interest in the property and franchises of the Northern
Securities company. The individual stockholders of the

Northern Pacific Railway Company were no longer to hold
an interest in the property or draw their dividends from the
earnings of the Northern Pacific system, and the individual
stockholders of the Great Northern Railway Company were
no longer to hold an interest in the property or draw their
dividends from the earnings of the Great Northern system,
but having ceased to be stockholders in the railway companies
and having become stockholders in the holding corporation,
both were to draw their dividends from the earnings of both
systems, collected and distributed by the holding corporation.
In this manner, by making the stockholders of each system
jointly interested in both systems, and by practically pooling
the earnings of both systems for the benefit of the former stock-
holders of each, and by vesting the selection of the directors
and officers of each system in a common body, to wit, the
holding corporation, with not only the power but the duty
to pursue a policy which would promote the interests, not of
one system at the expense of the other, but of both at the
expense of the public, all inducement for competition between
the two systems was to be removed, a virtual consolidation
effected, and a monopoly of the interstate and foreign com-
merce formerly carried on by the two systems as independent
competitors established.
VII. In pursuance of the unlawful combination or conspiracy
aforesaid, and solely as an instrumentality through which to
effect the purposes thereof, on the 13th day of November, 1901,
the defendant, the Northern Securities Company, was organized
under the general laws of the State of New Jersey, with its prin-
cipal office in Hoboken, in said State, and with an authorized
capital stock of $400,000,000. A copy of the articles of incor-
poration of such company is attached to and made'a part of this
petition. Among the purposes and powers designedly inserted
in said articles is the purpose and power, not only to "pur-
chase" and "hold" "shares of the capital stock of any other
corporation or corporations," under which said company wrong-
fully claims and is exercising the power to acquire by exchange

and hold the stock of the Northern Pacific and the Great North-
ern Railway companies, but the purpose and power, while
owner thereof, "to exercise all the rights, powers, and privileges
of ownership;" that is, to vote such stock, collect the dividends
thereon, and in all respects act as a stockholder of such railway
companies; and the purpose and power "to aid in any manner
any corporation of which any bonds or
stock are held, and to do any acts or things designed
to protect, preserve, improve, or enhance the value of any such
bonds or stock," meaning thereby to do whatever
it may deem necessary to aid in any manner the Northern Pa-
cific and the Great Northern Railway companies, or to preserve
or enhance the value of their stocks or bonds.
VIII. In further pursuance of the unlawful combination or
conspiracy aforesaid, and solely as an instrumentality through
which to effect the purposes thereof, on or about the 14th (lay
of November, 1901, the defendant the Northern Securities
Company was organized by the election of a board of directors
and the selection of a president and other officers, the defendant
James J. Hill, the president and controlling power in the
management of the defendant the Great Northern Railway
Company, being chosen a director and president thereof; and
thereupon, in further pursuance of the unlawful combination or
conspiracy aforesaid, the defendants James J. Hill and his asso-
ciate stockholders of the defendant the Great Northern Railway
Company assigned and transferred to the defendant the North-
ern Securities Company, a large amount of the capital stock of
the Great Northern Railway Company, the exact amount being
unknown to complainant, but constituting a controlling interest
therein, and complainant believes a majority thereof, upon the
agreed basis of exchange of 8180, par value, of the capital stock
of the said Northern Securities Company for each share of the
capital stock of the Great Northern Railway Company; and the
defendants J. Pierpont Morgan and his associate stockholders of
the Northern Pacific Railway Company assigned and trans-
ferred to the defendant the Northern Securities Company a
