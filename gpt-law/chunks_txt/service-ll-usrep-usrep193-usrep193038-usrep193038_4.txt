MONTAGUE & CO. v. LOWRY.
193 U. S. Opinion of the Court.
trarily determined by the association. The constitution pro-
vided for the appointment of an executive committee, whose
-duty it was to examine all applications for membership in
and to report on the same to the association, after which it
was to decide whether the applicants should be admitted or
not. If they were not acceptable the applicants would not
be admitted, and whether they were or not, was a matter for
the arbitrary decision of the association. Its decision that
they were not acceptable was sufficient to bar their entrance.
Again, it appears that plaintiffs were not eligible under the
constitution, because they did not always carry stock worth
$3,000, which by section 1 of article I, was made a condition
of eligibility to membership. True, it was stated in evidence
that this provision had not been enforced, but there was no
averment or proof that it had been repealed, and there was
nothing to prevent its enforcement at any time that an appli-
cation was made by any one who would not come up to the con-
dition. The case stands, therefore, that the plaintiffs had not
been asked to join the association at its formation ; that they
did not fill the condition provided for in its constitution as to
eligibility, and that if they had applied their application was
subject to arbitrary rejection.
The plaintiffs, however, could not, by virtue of any agree-
ment contained in such association, be legally put under obli-
gation to become members in order to enable them to transact
their business as they had theretofore done, and to purchase
tiles as they had been accustomed to do before the associa-
tion was formed.
The consequences of non-membership were grave, if not
disastrous, to the plaintiffs. It has already been shown how
the prices of tiles were enhanced so far as plaintiffs were con-
cerned, and how by means of this combination interstate com-
merce was affected.
The purchase and sale of tiles between the manufacturers in
one State and dealers therein in California was interstate com-
merce within the Addyston. Pipe case, 175 U. S. 211. It was
not a combination or monopoly among manufacturers simply,
but one between them and dealers in the manufactured article,

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court. 193 U. S.
which was an article of commerce between the States. (Tv ited
States v. E C. Knight Company, 156 U. S. 1, (lid not therefore
cover it. It is not brought within either Ihpkins v. United
States, 171 U. S. 578, or Anderson v. United States, 171 U.
S. 604. In the first case it was held that the occupation of
the members of the association was not interstate commerce,
and in the other that the subject matter of the agreement did
not directly relate to, embrace or act upon interstate com-
merce, for the reasons which are therein stated at length.
Upon examination we think it is entirely clear that the facts
in the case at bar bear no resemblance to the facts set forth
in either of the above cases and are not within the reasoning
of either. The agreement directly affected and restrained
interstate commerce.
The case we regard as a plain one and it is unnecessary to
further enlarge upon it.
There is one other question which, although of secondary
importance, is raised by the plaintiffs in error. After the
rendition of the verdict the plaintiffs below claimed a reason-
able attorney's fee under the seventh section of the act, and
made proof of what would be a reasonable sum therefor, from
which it appeared that it would be from $750 to $l,0OO. The
trial court awarded to the plaintiffs $750. The verdict being
only for $500, the plaintiffs in error claimed that the allowance
was an improper and unreasonable one. The trial took sonic
five days. The judgment in effect pronounced the association
illegal. The amount of the attorney's fee was within the dis-
cretion of the trial court, reasonably exercised, and we do not.
think that in this case such discretion was abused.
The judgment is
