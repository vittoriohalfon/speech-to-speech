the spindle, since it had not been informed of its existence by
the diver, who does not seem to have been guilty of any neg-
ligence in not discovering it, and for whose negligence it is at
least doubtful whether respondent would have been liable.
Inasmuch as we are of opinion that the Circuit Court of
Appeals was in error in holding the respondent liable,
The decree of the Circuit Court of July 7, 1891, must be
afirmed, and the cause remanded to that court, with direc-
tionsto dismiss the libel.
UNITED STATES v. TRANS-MISSOURI FREIGHT
ASSOCIATION.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 6. Argued December 8, 9,1896. - Decided March 22, 1897.
The dissolution of the freight association does not prevent this court from
taking cognizance of the appeal and deciding the case on its merits; as,
where parties have entered into an illegal agreement and are acting
under it, and there is no adequate remedy at law, and the jurisdiction
of'the court has attached by the filing of a bill to restrain such or like
action under a similar agreement, and a trial has been had and judgment
entered, the appellate jurisdiction of this court is not ousted by a simple
dissolution of the association, effected subsequently to the entry of judg-
ment in the suit.
While the statutory amount must as a matter of fact be in controversy, yet
the fact that it is so need not appear in the bill, but may be shown to the
satisfaction of the court.
The provisions respecting contracts, combinations and conspiracies in re-
straint of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign
countries, contained in the act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, "to protect trade
and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies," apply to and
cover common carriers by railroad; and a contract between them in
restraint of such trade or commerce is prohibited, even though the con-
tract is entered into between competing railroads, only for the purpose
of thereby affecting traffic rates for the transportation of persons and
property.
The act of February 4, 1887, c. 104, "to regulate commerce," is not incon-

sistent with the act of July 2, 1890, as it (toes not confer upon compet-
ing railroad companies power to enter into a contract in restraint of
trade and commerce, like the one which forms the subject of this suit.
Debates in Congress are not appropriate sources of information, from
which to discover the meaning of the language of a statute passed by
that body.
The prohibitory provisions of the said act of July 2, 1890, apply to all con-
tracts in restraint of interstate or foreign trade or commerce without
exception or limitation; and are not confined to those in which the
restraint is unreasonable.
In order to maintain this suit the government is not obliged to show that
the agreement in question was entered into for the purpose of restrain-
ing trade or commerce, if such restraint is its necessary effect.
This agreement, though legal when made, became illegal on the passage of
the act of July 2, 1890, and acts done under it after that statute became
operative were done in violation of it.
The fourth section of the act Invests the Government with full power and
authority to bring such a suit as this; and, if the facts alleged are
proved, an injunction should issue.
ON the 2d of July, 1890, an act was passed by the Congress
of the United States, entitled " An' act to protect trade and
commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies." 26

Statement of the Case.
On the 15th day of March, 1889, all but three of the
defendants, the railway companies named in the bill, made
and entered into an agreement by which they formed them-
selves into an association to be known as the "Trans-Missouri
Freight Association," and they agreed to be governed by the
provisions contained in the articles of agreement.
The memorandum of agreement entered into between the
railway companies named therein, stated, among other things,
as follows: "For the purpose of mutual protection by estab-
lishing and maintaining reasonable rates, rules and regulations
on all freight traffic, both through and local, the subscribers
do hereby form an association to be known as the Trans-
Missouri Freight Association, and agree to be governed by
the following provisions."
" ARTICLE I.
"The traffic to be included in the Trans-Missouri Freight
Association shall be as follows:
States or of the District of Columbia, or in restraint of trade or commerce
between any such Territory and another, or between any such Territory or
Territories and any State or States or the District of Columbia, or with
foreign nations, or between the District of Columbia and any State or
States or foreign nations, is hereby declared illegal. Every person who
shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or con-
spiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction
thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by
imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the
discretion of the court.
SEC. 4. The several Circuit Courts of the United States are hereby in-
vested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of this act; and
it shall be the duty of the several district attorneys of the United States, in
their respective districts, under the direction of the Attorney General, to
institute proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations.
Such proceedings may be by way of petition setting forth the case and
praying that such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited.
When the parties complained of shall have been duly notified of such
petition the court shall proceed, as soon as may be, to the hearing and de-
termination of the case; and pending such petition and before final decree,
the court may at any time make such temporary restraining order or prohi-
bition as shall be deemed just in the premises.
SEC. 5. Whenever it shall appear to the court before which any proceed-
