suppresses competition. If that territory embraces more
States than one the combination restrains interstate com-
inerce. Addyston Pspe & Steel Co. v United States, 175 U S.
211, 240.
Whether a combination in restraint of trade operates upon
interstate or only intrastate commerce does not depend upon
whether the individual transactions of its members, standing
alone and viewed separate and apart from the purpose and
necessary effect of the whole combination, are interstate or
intrastate in character, and the petition here discloses a com-
bination which operates upon znterstate commerce, for whatever
may be the character of the individual transactions of its
several members, it is also true in this case that the individual
transactions of the members of the combination do fall within
the jurisdiction conferred upon Congress by the commerce
clause of the Constitution. These transactions consist of the
defendants' purchases of live stock, the sales and shipments of
fresh meats made directly by the defendants to dealers and
consumers in the several States, and the sales of fresh meats
to dealers and consumers in the several States by agents of the
defendants located in those States.
From all over the stock-raising section, embracing many
different States, cattle, sheep and hogs are habitually shipped
to the great live-stock markets at Chicago, Omaha, Sioux City,
St. Joseph, Kansas City, East St. Louis and St. Paul for sale,
to those, the defendants chief among them, engaged in the
business of converting live stock into fresh meats for human
consumption. The shipments are made with the express and
sole purpose of §ale as soon as market conditions will permit,
and the sales are made while the cattle yet remain in first
hands, that is, in the hands of the owners or their agents, and
in the ordinary form or condition in which cattle are shipped
from one country or State to another, which is analogous
to the form or condition of the original package in the case
of merchandise. Austin v Tennessee, 179 U S. 343,
359.

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Argument for the United States. 196 U. S.
The cattle are not dealt with in a commercial way from the
time of their arrival until their sale to the defendants and
others, but are simply fed and cared for. No act is done with
reference to them that would cause them to become mixed
with the general mass of local property Now, it may be that,
a distinction should be made between what may be called an
interstate sale proper and in the full sense of the term-that is,
a sale between persons negotiating and dealing from two or
more different States, and a sale, at its destination and while it
still remains in the original state or package, of an article of
commerce sent from another State. But so far as the result
in this instance is concerned it is a distinction without a differ-
ence. If the sales of live stock set forth in the petition do not
fall within the first of these classes they certainly fall within the
second, and that brings them within the protection of the
Federal power over commerce and therefore within the pro-
tection of the Anti Trust Act; for the right to transport articles
of commerce from one State to another includes the right of
the owner or consignee to sell them in the latter free from any
burden or restraint that the States might attempt to impose.

Paragraph 2 of the bill contains matter of description and
inducement, and must be read in conjunction with the stating
part of the petition, which alleges, -intera lia, that "in order to
restrain and destroy competition among themselves" the de-
fendants have engaged in a "combination and conspiracy to
arbitrarily from time to time raise, lower, and fix prices, and
to maintain uniform prices at which they will sell, directly or
through their respective agents, such fresh meats to dealers
and consumers throughout the said States and Territories and
the District of Columbia and foreign countries."

1906 U. S. Argument for the United States.
As the sales made directly by the defendants to dealers and
consumers throughout the United States are interstate sales,
and as decisions of this court have settled that a combination
to control and suppress competition in such sales is a combina-
tion in restraint of interstate commerce, the petition in this
case, having shown that much, cannot in any event be dis-
missed, even should it be held to have failed in all other
respects.
Paragraph 3 of the petition states that the defendants are
engaged in shipping fresh meats from their plants in certain
States to their respective agents at and near the principal
markets in other States and Territories for sale by such agents
to dealers and consumers in those States and Territories.
Upon the question whether or not the sales made by these
agents under the circumstances set forth are within the body
of interstate commerce, there is nothing to add to the cogent
argument in the opinion of the circuit judge.
The bill is not multifarious and does not disclose a mis-
joinder of parties. 14 Ency of P1. and Pr. 198, 1 Bates Fed.
Eq. Pro. §§ 135, 195. The Circuit Court did not err in sus-
taining the demurrers to the bill in its aspect as a bill of dis-
covery The demurrers are demurrers to the whole bill.
Lwngston v Story, 9 Pet. 632, 654.
The well-settled rule of equity pleading is that a demurrer
to a whole bill cannot be sustained as to part of the bill and
overruled as to part, but must be overruled as to the whole if
any part of the bill is good and entitles the complainant to
any relief. Fletcher, Eq. P1. §§ 203, 204, Story, Eq. Pl.,
10th ed., §§ 443, 444, Parkerv Simpson, 62 N. E. Rep. (Mass.)
401, Metler's Admn's. v Metler, 18 N. J Eq. 270, 273. When
the defendants leveled their demurrers at the relief as well as
the discovery, instead of answering as to the relief and de-
murring as to the discovery they did so at their peril. Daniell's
