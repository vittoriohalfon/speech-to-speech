States and with foreign nations "is complete in itself and may
be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no ]iuita-
tions other than are prescribed in the Constitution;" and that if
the end to be accomplished is within the scope of the ('onstitu-
tion, "all means which are appropriate, which are plainly
adapted to that end and which are not prohibited, are con-
stitutional."
The plenary authority of Congress over interstate commerce,
its right to regulate it to the fullest extent, to fix the rates to
be charged for the movement of interstate commerce, to legis-
late concerning the ways and vehicles actually engaged in such
traffic, and to exert any and every other power over such
commerce which flows from the authority conferred by the
Constitution, is thus conceded. But the concessions thus
made do not concern the question in this case, which is not
the scope of the power of Congress to regulate commerce, but
whether the power extends to regulate the ownership of stock
in railroads, which is not commerce at all. The confusion
which results from failing to observe this distinction will
appear from an accurate analysis of Gibbons v. Ogden, for in
that case the great Chief Justice was careful to define the
commerce, the power to regulate which was conferred upon
Congress, and in the passages which I have previously quoted,
simply pointed out the rule by which it was to be determined
in any case whether Congress, in acting upon the subject, had
gone beyond the limits of the power to regulate commerce as
it was defined in the opinion. Accepting the test announced
in Gibbons v. Ogden for determining whether a given exercise
of the power to regulate commerce has in effect transcended
the limits of regulation, it is essential to accept also the lumi-
nous definition of commerce announced in that case andap-
proved so many times since, and hence to test the question for
decision by that definition. The definition is this: "Commerce
undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more, it is inter-
course. It describes the commercial intercourse between na-
tions and parts of nations in all its branches, and is regulated

by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse." (Italics
mine.)
Does the delegation of authority to Congress to regulate
commerce among the States embrace the power to regulate
the ownership of stock in state corporations, because such
corporations may be in part engaged in interstate commerce?
Certainly not, if such question is to be governed by the defini-
tion of commerce just quoted from Gibbons v. Ogden. Let me
analyze the definition. "Commerce undoubtedly is traffic,
but it is something more, it is intercourse;" that is, traffic
between the States and intercourse between the States. I
think the ownership of stock in a state corporation cannot be
said to be in any sense traffic between the States or intercourse
between them. The definition continues: "It describes the
commercial intercourse between nations and parts of nations."
Can the ownership of stock in a state corporation, by the most
latitudinarian construction, be embraced by the words "com-
mercial intercourse between nations and parts of nations?"
And to remove all doubt, the definition points out the meaning
of the delegation of power to regulate, since it says that it is
to be "regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that inter-
course." Can it in reason be maintained that to prescribe
rules governing the ownership of stock within a State in a
corporation created by it is within the power to prescribe
rules for the regulation of intercourse between citizens of
different States?
But if the question be looked at with reference to the powers
of the Federal and state governments, the general nature of
the one and the local character of the other, which it was the
purpose of the Constitution to create and perpetuate, it seems
to me evident that the contention that the authority of the
National Government under the commerce clause gives the
right to Congress to regulate the ownership of stock in railroads
chartered by state authority, is absolutely destructive of the
Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that
"the powers not delegated to the United States by the Consti-

tution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the
States respectively or to the people." This must follow, since
the authority of Congress to regulate on the subject, can in
reason alone rest upon the proposition that its power over
commerce embraces the right to control the ownership of rail-
roads doing in part an interstate commerce business. But.
power to control the ownership of all such railroads would
necessarily embrace their organization. Hence it would result
that it would be in the power of Congress to abrogate every
such railroad charter granted by the States from the beginning
if Congress deemed that the rights conferred by such state
charters tended to restrain commerce between the States or
to create a monopoly concerning the same.
Besides, if the principle be acceded to, it must in reason be
held to embrace every consolidation of state railroads which
may do in part an interstate commerce business, even although
such consolidation may have been expressly authorized by the
laws of the States creating the corporations.
It would likewise overthrow every state law forbidding such
consolidations, for if the ownership of stock in state corpora-
tions be within the regulating power of Congress under the
commerce clause and can be prohibited by Congress, it would
be within the power of that body to permit that which it had
the right to prohibit.
But the principle that the ownership of property is embraced
within the power of Congress to regulate commerce, whenever
that body deems that a particular character of ownership, if
allowed to continue, may restrain commerce between the States
or create a monopoly thereof, is in my opinion in conflict with
the most elementary conceptions of rights of property. For
it would follow if Congress deemed that the acquisition by
one or more individuals engaged in interstate commerce of
more than a certain amount of property would be prejudicial
to interstate commerce, the amount of property held or the
amount which could be employed in interstate commerce
could be regulated.
