cient to form a belief of each and every other allegation of
Paragraph VIII of the petition.
IX. This defendant denies any knowledge or information
sufficient to form a belief of each and every allegation of Para-
graph IX of the petition.
X. This defendant denies any knowledge or information
sufficient to form a belief of each and every allegation of Para-
graph X of the petition.
XI. This defendant denies each and every allegation of Para-
graph XI of the petition.
XII. This defendant denies each and every allegation of Para-
graph XII of the petition. It is informed and believes that
said paragraph consists merely of expressions of opinion, and
is, therefore, without weight in support of any cause of action.
XIII. This defendant denies any knowledge or information
sufficient to form a belief of each and every allegation of Para-
graph XIII of the petition.
XIV. As this defendant is informed and believes, the pur-
chase by the Northern Securities Company of shares of stock
of this defendant and the sale thereof by the owners have been
expressly authorized by law. They have had no effect what-
ever, in law or in fact, in restraint or monopoly of trade or com-
merce among the several States or. with foreign nations. The
petition does not allege that at any place within the jurisdiction
of this court or elsewhere any such restraint or monopoly has
been effected.
If these lawful transactions, consisting merely of the pur-
chase and sale of property, should hereafter have any effect in
restraint or monopoly of trade or commerce among the several
States or with foreign nations, that would not be their direct
effect, but would be merely indirect, remote, incidental, and col-
lateral, and would, therefore, not bring said transactions within
said act of Congress above mentioned. Any other construction
would render the statute unconstitutional, as beyond the power
of Congress, and as depriving the sellers of the stock thus sold
and also the stockholders of this defendant who have not sold

their shares to the Securities Company, of liberty and property
without due process of law, because, thus construed, it would
be an inhibition upon their right to sell their property. If
complainant's contention be sustained, the right of the owner
of property to sell the same will be dependent upon what the
courts at any future time may hold to have been the intention
of the purchaser in buying such property. This result would
seriously impair the liberty of the owner and the value of his
property, and is contrary to the constitutional guaranties
thereof.
These transactions are, therefore, not within the act of Con-
gress above mentioned; nor has Congress any constitutional
power to annul or prohibit action thus expressly authorized by
state statutes under which the same has been or may hereafter
be taken.
XV. There is a defect of necessary parties defendant herein,
because in this suit it is sought to annul all sales of shares made
by shareholders of this defendant to the Northern Securities
Company and to cancel all certificates of stock of the latter
company issued in purchase of the same. The parties nmaking
such sales are numerous, and many of them had no connection
With the matter save to sell their shares to the Securities Com-
pany after its organization. It is obvious that in their a bsence
no adjudication can be made annulling such sales to the Securi-
ties Company. A decree to such effect as prayed for by the
petition necessarily would deprive such original sellers of their
property without due process of law. All persons who sold
shares in this defendant to the Securities Company are, there-
fore, necessary parties, and the petition is bad by reason of
their absence.
XTI. And this defendant denies all and all manner of un-
lawful combination and confederacy wherewith it is by the said
petition charged, without this, that if there is any other m'atter,
cause, or thing in the petition contained material or necessary
for this defendant to make answer unto, and not herein or here-
by well and sufficiently answered, confessed, traversed, a"nd

avoided or denied, the same is not true to the knowledge or
belief of this defendant; all of which matters and things this
defendant is ready and willing to aver, maintain, and prove as
this honorable court shall direct, and humbly prays to be hence
dismissed with its reasonable costs and charges in this behalf
most wrongfully sustained.
The first five paragraphs of the answer of the defendants,
J. Pierpont Morgan and Robert Bacon, were substantially the
same as the same paragraphs of the answer of the Northern
Pacific Railway and the remainder of the answer of such de-
fendants was as follows:
VI. These defendants admit that the defendant James J.
Hill and certain other persons decided upon the formation of
a securities company for the purposes set forth in the certificate
of incorporation of the Northern Securities Company attached
to the petition and in all respects as therein stated.
These defendants deny each and every other allegation of
Paragraph VI of the petition.
VII. These defendants admit the allegations of Paragraph
VII of the petition that on November 13, 1901, the defendant
Northern Securities Company was organized under the general
laws of the State of New Jersey, with its principal office in
Hoboken, in said State, and with an authorized capital stock of
$400,000,000, and that a copy of the articles of incorporation
of said company correctly stating its powers is attached to the
petition.
These defendants deny each and every other allegation of
Paragraph VII of the petition.
VIII. These defendants admit the allegations of Paragraph
VIII of the petition that on or about November 14, 1901, the
defendant Northern Securities Company was organized by the
election of directors and officers; that the defendant James J.
Hill was chosen a director and president thereof; that there-
upon the said James J. Hill and other stockholders of the
Great Northern Company, each individually and separately
