court that interstate commerce embraces something more than
the mere physical transportation of articles of property, and
the vehicles or vessels by which such transportation is effected.
In County of -Mobile v Zimball, 102 U S. 691, 702, it was
said that "commerce with foreign countries and among the
States, strictly considered, consists in intercourse and traffic,
including, in these terms, navigation and the transportation
and transit of persons and property, as well as the purchase,
sale, and exchange of commodities." In Gloucester -FerryC o.
v Pennsylvanta, 114 U S. 196, 203, the language of the court
was "Commerce among the States consists of intercourse
and traffic between their citizens, and includes the transporta-
tion of persons and property, and the navigation of public
waters for that purpose, as well as the purchase, sale, and
exchange of commodities. The power to regulate that com-
merce, as well as commerce with foreign nations, vested in
Congress, is the power to prescribe the rules by which it shall
be governed, that is, the conditions upon which it shall be con-
ducted, to determine when it shall be free, and when subject
to duties or other exactions." In Hidd v Pearson, 128
U S. 1, 20, it was said that "the buying and selling, and the
transportation vncdental thereto constitute commerce." Inter-
state commerce does not, therefore, consist in transportation
simply It includes the purchase and sale of articles that are
intended to be transported from one State to another - every
species of commercial intercourse among the States and with
foreign nations.
In the light of these principles, determining as well the
scope of the power to regulate commerce among the States as
the nature of such commerce, we are to inquire whether the
act of Congress of July 2, 1890, c. 647, entitled "An act to
protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and
monopolies," 26 Stat. 209, is repugnant to the Constitution.
By that act "every contract, combination in the form of
trust or otherwse, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or com-
merce among the several States or with foreign nations," is
declared to be illegal, and every person making any such
contract, or engaging in any such combination or conspiracy,

is to be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and punishable, on
conviction, by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or
by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said
punishments in the discretion of the court. ยง 1. It is also
made a misdemeanor, punishable in like manner, for any per-
son to "monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or
conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize, any
part of the trade or commerce among the several States or with
foreign nations." ยง 2. The act also declares illegal "every
contract, combination in form of trust or otherwise, or con-
spiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in any Territory
of the United States or of the District of Columbia, or in
restraint of trade or commerce between any such Territory
and another, or between any such Territory or Territories or
any State or States or the District of Columbia, or with for-
eign nations, or between the District of Columbia and any
State or States or foreign nations," and prescribes the-same
punishments for every person making any such contract, or
engaging in any such combination or conspiracy ยง 3.
The fourth section of the act is in these words "Sec. 4. The
several Circuit Courts of the United States are hereby invested
with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of this act,
and it shall be the duty of the several district attorneys of the
United States, in their respective districts, under the direction
of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings in equity to
prevent and restrain such violations. Such proceedings may
be by way of petition setting forth the case and praying that
such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited. When
the parties complained of shall have been duly notified of
such petition the court shall proceed, as soon as may be, to
the hearing and determination of the case, and pending such
petition and before final decree, the court may at any time
make such temporary restraining order or prohibition as shall
be deemed just in the premises."
It would seem to be indisputable that no combnahon of
corporations or individuals can, of mght, impose unlawful
restraints upon mterstate trade, whether upon transportation.
or upon such interstate intercourse and traffic as precede trans-

portation, any more than it can, of right, impose unreasonable
restraints upon the completely internal traffic of a State. The
supposition cannot be indulged that this general proposition
will be disputed. If it be true that a combnatwn of corpora-
tions or individuals may, so far as the power of Congress is
concerned, subject interstate trade, in any of its stages, to
unlawful restraints, the conclusion is inevitable that the Con-
stitution has failed to accomplish -one primary object of the
Union, which was to place commerce among the States under
the control of the common government of all the people, and
thereby relieve or protect it against burdens or restrictions
imposed, by whatever authority, for the benefit of particular
localities or special interests.
The fundamental inquiry in this case is, What, in a legal
sense, is an unlawful restraint of trade 2
Sir William Erle, formerly Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas, in his essay on the Law Relating to Trade Unions, well
said that "restraint of trade, according to a general principle
of the common law, is unlawful;" that "at common law every
person has individually, and the public also have collectvely, a
right to require that the course of trade should be kept free
from unreasonable obstructon , " and that "the right to a
free course for trade is of great importance to commerce and
productive industry, and has been carefully maintained by
those who have administered the common law" pp. 6, 7, 8.
There is a partial restraint of trade which, m certain circum-
stances, is tolerated by the law The rule upon that subject
is stated in Oregon Steam Nay. Co. v Winsor, 20 Wall. 64,
66, where it was said that "an agreement m general restraint
of trade is illegal and void, but an agreement which operates
merely in partial restraint of trade is good, provided it be not
unreasonable and there be a consideration to support it. In
order that it may not be unreasonable, the restraint imposed
must not be larger than is required for the necessary protec-
tion of the party with whom the contract is made. -Horner
v Graves, 7 Bing. 735, 743. A contract, even on good con-
sideration, not to use a trade anywhere in England is held
void in that country as being too general a restraint of trade."
