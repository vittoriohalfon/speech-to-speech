ANDERSON v. UITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.
of gondnct upon interstate commerce is quite remote, not in-
tended and too small to be taken into account.
The agreement lacks, too, every ingredient of a monopoly.
Every one can become a member of the association, and the
natural desire of each member to do as much business as he
could would not be in the least diminished by reason of mem-
bership, while the business done would still be the individual
and private business of each member; and each would be in
direct and immediate competition with each and all of the
other members. If all engaged in the business were to be-
come members of the association, yet, as-the association itself
does no business, it can and does monopolize none. The
amount and value of interstate trade is not at all directly
affected by such membership; the competition among the
members and with others who are seeking purchasers would
be as large as it would otherwise have been, and the only re-
sult of the agreement would be that no yard traders would
remain who were not members of the association. It has no
tendency, so far as can be gathered from its object or from
the language of its rules and regulations, to limit the extent
of the demand for cattle or to limit the number of cattle
marketed or to limit or reduce their price or to place any im-
pediment or obstacle in the course of the commercial stream
which flows into the Kansas City cattle market. While in
case all the yard traders are not induced to become members
of the association, and those who are such membeks refuse to
recognize the others in business, we can see no such direct,
necessary or natural connection between that fact and the
restraint of interstate commerce as to render the agreement
not to recognize them void for that reason. A claim that
such refusal may thereby lessen the number of active traders
on the market, and thus possibly reduce the demand for and
the prices of the cattle there set up for sale, and so affect
interstate trade, is entirely too remote and fanciful to be
accepted as valid.
This case is unlike that of Hopkins v. Oxley Stave Company,
83 Fed. Rep. 912, to which our attention has been called. The
case cited was decided without reference to the act of Con-

Syllabus.
gress upon which alone the case at bar is prosecuted, and the
agreement was held void at common law as a conspiracy
to wrongfully deprive the plaintiff of its right to manage its
business according to the dictates of its own judgment. It
was also said that the fact could not be overlooked that
another object of the conspiracy was to deprive the public at
large of the benefits to be derived from a labor-saving machine
whibh seemed to the court to be one of great utility. No
question as to interstate commerce arose and none was decided.
From what has already been said regarding rule 10, it
would seem to follow that the other rules (11, 12 and 13) are of
equal validity as rule 10, and for the same reasons. The rules
are evidently of a character to enforce the purpose and object
of the exchange as set forth in the preamble, and we think
that for such purpose they are reasonable and fair. They can
possibly affect interstate trade or commerce in blit a remote
way, and are not void as violations of the act of Congress.
TWe are of opinion therefore that the order in this case should
be reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Westen Division qf the Western
Districto f Missouri with directions to dismiss the com-
plainants' bill wiAh costs.-

A description in a chattel mortgage of a given number of articles or ant-

the facts.
