UNITED STATES v. JOINT TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION. 529
Mr. Phelps' Argument for the New York Central Railroad Company.
The agreement in this case is not "in restraint of trade or
commerce." The theory of the bill appears to-be that the
agreement comes within this description, because it tends to
restrict competition, and because any agreement that restrains
competition is "in restraint of trade." B6th these assumptions
are erroneous, the one in fact, the other in law. The agree-
ment does not restrain competition to any such appreciable
extent as would justify an injunction, eicept that competition.
which is unlawful because it is secret.
Assuming, against the fact, that a certain restriction of com-
petition is the necessary result of this agreement if it is al-
lowed to proceed, it plainly appears by its terms to be only
such restriction of competition as is necessary to secure "just
and reasonable rates."
By the Interstate Commerce act all rates are required to be
"reasonable and just." Every unjust and unreasonable charge
is made unlawful. Schedules of rates, as has been pointed out,
are required to be published and kept open to public inspec-
tion, and to be filed with the Commissioners; and not to be
changed without due notice to the public and the Commis-
sioners. Ample remedies, criminal and civil, are pr,'vided for
the violation of these requirements, the enforcement of which
is made the duty of the Commissioners, and the companies
are also made subject to the state laws regulating rates.
The precise question, therefore, under this clause of the
Anti-Trust act, is whether a contract that produces a result
which the Interstate Commerce act in terms authorizes and
piovides for, and helps to repress a practice which that act for-
bids, is for that reason a contract for the unlawful restraint of
trade. Or, in other words, whether it can be made unlawful
by a forced construction of the general provisions of one
statute of tho United States, for a carrier company to provide
by a traffic contract for the maintenance of those "just and
reasonable rates" which another statute of. the United States
not only authorizes, but creates elaborate means for making
permanent, and for preventing the secret changes of rates
which the Interstate Commerce act prohibits.
It is the statutes themselves that have prescribed a defini-

tion of this clause of the Anti-Trust act, so far as it applies to
railway traffic contracts, if it is held to apply to them at all,
whatever its meaning as to other contracts may be.
That the just and reasonable rates of transportation which
the Interstate Commerce act contemplates and provides for,
are rates that are just and reasonable to the carriers as well
as to the carried, cannot be open.to doubt. The very words
"just and reasonable" employed in that act, necessarily imply
that meaning. They are words of comparison and relation,
aild unless the rights of both parties to a contract are con-
sidered, there can be no comparison. It would be preposter-
ous to call a price just and reasonable, that was not so to one
side as well as to the other. This is the construction which
this court have given to the Interstate Commerce act in this
very particular.
The validity of the agreement here in question must be
determined, therefore, not merely upon the language of the
Anti-Trust act taken by itself, but by that language consid-
ered in connection with the other statute of the United States
which (if this applies) is in pari materia, and which deals
with the subject so much more exhaustively, and in words so
plain that there can bd no ambiguity raised in respect of them.
Granting that .the Anti-Trust act in terms makes all contracts
unlawful that are in anywise "in restriction of trade," how-
ever reasonable and necessary they may be, is that, to be
undeistood to invalidate a railway contract made to secure
that, and only that, which the Interstate Commerce act as
construed by this court recognizes as the right of railway
companies to receive, and provides means to secure? It will
hardly be claimed that the elaborate provisions of the Inter-
state Commerce act on the subject of reasonable rates are
repealed by the Anti-Trust act. If both are to stand, as
applicable to this case, they must be read together, the same
as if their provisions were contained (so far as they refer to
the same subject) in. separate sections of the same act.
Quite aside from the provisions of the Interstate Commerce
act, giving'to the companies the right to just and reasonable
rates, and to use proper means to maintain them, the same

result is reached under the principles of the common law.
The term "1r estraint of trade" employed in the Anti-Trust
statute has a common law definition. And as the act fur-
nishes no other, that, upon the general rules of construction,
must be taken to be intended. To make the agreement an
infringement of this statute, it must, therefore, be one that
would be void at common law. It is respectfully submitted
on this point that in the construction of statutes the rule is
absolutely without exception, that where a word or phrase
employed has a well-settled common law definition distinct
from its literal meaning, that is assumed to be the meaning
intended, unless a different definition is prescribed in the
statute. Even the Constitution of the United States, a politi-
cal document of an entirely unique character, has been from
the outset subjected by this court to this rule of construction.
Even if it should be held that the language of the Anti-Trust
act forbids any contract in restraint of trade, however just,
reasonable and necessary, the agreement here in question
would not fall within the prohibition, because it does not tend
to restrain trade or commerce, but rather to promote them.
A restraint upon excessive and unwholesome competition is
not a restraint upon trade, but is necessary to its maintenance.
This view is so fully presented and discussed in the brief
of Messrs. Carter 'and Ledyard, that further argument in sup-
port of it is not requisite.
There is no ground whatever for asserting that the agree-
ment infringes the provision of the Anti-Trust act against
monopolies.
The definition of the word "monopoly," both in its legal
and its ordinary signification, is the concentration of a busi-
ness or employment in the hands of one, or at most, of a few.
That is the plain meaning of it as employed in the act. No
feature of the agreement, in any view that can be taken of it,
approaches this definition.
So far from tending toward the concentration of railroad
transportation in fewer hands, it does not in any possible event
withdraw it from a single road now in existence, nor throw
the least obstacle in the way of the construction of others.
