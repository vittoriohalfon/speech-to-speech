Opinion of the Court. 194 U. S.
express command of the act of 1875, its duty is to prodeed no
further. That is manifest from the fifth section of that act,
which provides: " That if, in any suit commenced in a Circuit
Court or removed from a state court to a Circuit Court of the
United States, it shall appear to the satisfaction of said Circuit
Court, at any time after such suit has been brought or removed
thereto, that such suit does not really and sfibstantially involve
a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of
said Circuit Court, or that the parties to said suit have been
improperly or collusively made or joined, either as plaintiffs
or defendants, for the purpose of creating a case cognizable or
removable under this act, the said Circuit Court shall proceed
no further therein, but shall dismiss the suit or remand it to the
court from which it was removed as justice may require, and shall
make such order as to costs as shall be just." 18 Stat. 470.
That provision has not been superseded by any subsequent
legislation.
Does the present suit really and substantially involve a,
dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of the
Circuit Court? That is to say, could the suit, as disclosed by
the complaint, have been brought by the State originally in
that court? If it could not, then, under the act of 1887 -8 and
the adjudged cases, it should not have been removed from the
state court and should be remanded.
By the first section of the Anti-Trust Act every contract,
combination in the form of a trust or otherwise, or conspiracy,
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, is
declared to be illegal. The second section condemns the
monopolizing or attempting to monopolize, or combining or
conspiring to monopolize, any part of such trade or commerce.
By the third section, every contract, combination in the form
of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of commerce
in any Territory of the United States or the District of Co-
lumbia, or in restraint of trade or commerce between any such
Territory and another, or between any such Territory or Terri-
tories and any State or States or the District of Columbia, or

with any foreign States, or between the District of Columbia
and any State or States or foreign nations, is declared to be
illegal. A violation of the provisions of each section is made
a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not exceeding five thou-
sand dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding one year' or by
both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. Of
course, a criminal prosecution under the act must be in the
name of the United States and in a court of the United States-,
the District Attorney who conducts the prosecution being
subject to the direction of the Attorney General as to the
manner in which his duties shall be discharged. Rev. Stat.
362.
The fourth, sixth, seventh and. eighth sections of the act are
as follows:
"SEC. 4. The several Circuit Courts of the United States are
hereby invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain viola-
tions of this act; and it shall be the duty of the several Dis-
trict Attorneys of the United States, int heir respective dis-
tricts, under the direction of the Attorney General, to institute
proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations.
Such proceedings may be by way of petition setting forth the
case and praying that such violation shall be enjoined or other-
wise prohibited. When the parties complained of shall have
been duly notified of such petition the court shall proceed, as
soon as may be, to the hearing and determination of the case;
and, pending such petition and before final decree, the court
may at any time make such temporary restraining order or
prohibition as shall be deemed just in the premises."
"SEC. 6,A ny property owned under any contract or by any
combination, or pursuant to any conspiracy (and being the
subject thereof) mentioned in section one of this act, and being
in the course of transportation from one State to another, or to
a foreign country, shall be forfeited to the United States, and
may be seized and cohdemned by lik, proceedings as those
provided by law for the forfeiture, seizure and condemnation
of proplerty imported into the United States contrary to law.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court. 194 U. S.
"SEC. 7. Any person who shall be injured in his business or
property by any other person or corporation by reason of any-
thing forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act may sue
therefor in any Circuit Court of the United States in the dis-
trict in which the defendant resides or is found, without respect
to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the
damages by him sustained, and the costs of suit, including a
reasonable attorney's fee.
"SEc. 8. That the word 'person,' or 'persons terever used
in this act, shall be deemed to include corporations and associa-
tions existing under or authorized by the laws of either the
United States, the laws of any of the Territories, the laws of
any State or the laws of any foreign country." 26 Stat. 209.
It thus appears that the act specifies four modes in which
effect may be given to its provisions. It is clear that the pres-
ent suit does not belong to either of those classes. It is not a
criminal proceeding, (§§ 1, 2, 3,) nor a suit in equity in the name
of the United States to restrain violations of the Anti-Trust
Act, (§ 4,) nor a proceeding in the name of the United States
for the forfeiture of property being in thq course of transporta-
tion, (§ 6,) nor an action by any person or corporation for the
recovery of threefold damages for injury done to business or
property by some other person or corporation. (§§ 7, 8.)
But it is said that as the act of Congress was for the benefit
of all the States and all the people, this case is to be deemed
one arising under the laws of the United States, and, therefore,
cognizable by the Circuit Court, because one of the objects of
the State of Minnesota by its suit is to protect c( in of its
proprietary interests, which, it is alleged, would be injured by
violations, on the part of the defendants, of the act of Con-
gress. Let us see what, in that view, is the case as presented
by the complaint.
The complaint alleged that the State is the owner of more
than three million' acres of land, of the value of more than
fifteen millions of dollars, obtained, by donation, from the
United States, and that "the value of said lands, and the
