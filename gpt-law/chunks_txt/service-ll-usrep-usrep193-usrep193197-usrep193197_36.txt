the act if in interstate or international trade or commerce.
Trans-11issouriC ase, supra.
"To prevent or suppress competition" and "to restrain
trade" are, in fact, often used by judges as convertible terms
to express one and the same thought.
Mogul S. S. Co. v. McGregor, L. R. App. Cas. (1892), 25, was
decided upon common law principles, there being no statute,
such as the Federal Anti-Trust Act, making it unlawful and
criminal to enter into agreements or combinations in restraint
of trade.
Both the Court of Appeal and House of Lords held that, the
action could not be maintained because, even if it were in
restraint of trade, an agreement in restraint of trade was not
unlawful at common law in the sense that it furnished cause
for a civil action by one damaged by it, but only in the sense
that it was void and unenforceable if sued on.
The Government does not claim that ordinary corporations
and partnerships formed in good faith in ordinary course of
business come within the prohibitions of the act because inci-
dentally they may to some extent restrict competition, but
those where the corporation or partnership is formed for the
purpose of combining competing businesses. The act em-
braces not only monopolies but attempts to monopolize. The
term monopoly as used by modern legislators and judges
signifies the combining or bringing together in the hands of
one person or set of persons the control, or the power of control,
over a particular business or employment, so that competition
therein may be suppressed. People v. Chicago Gas Trust
Company, 130 Illinois, 294; People v. North River Sugar Re-
fining Co., 54 Hun (N. Y.), 377; United States v. E. C. Knight
Co., 156 U. S. 1. And as to railroads, see Pearsall v. Great
Northern Railway, 161 U. S. 646, 677; Louisville & Nashville
R. R. Co. v. Kentucky, 161 U. S. 677.
A combination or monopoly exists within the meaning of
the act even if the immediate effect of the acts complained of
is not to suppress competition or to create a complete monopoly.

193 U. S. Argument of Attorney General for United States.
It is sufficient to show that they tend to bring about those
results. Cases cited supra, and Salt Co. v. Guthrie, 35 Ohio St.
672.
It is not essential to show that the person or persons charged
with monopolizing or combining have actually raised prices or
suppressed competition, or restrained or monopolized trade or
commerce in order to bring them within the condemnation of
the act. It is enough that the necessary effect of the com-
bination or monopoly is to give them the power to do those
things. The decisive question is whether the power xists,
not whether it has been exercised. In the Trans-lissouri,
Joint Traffic, Pearsall and Addyston Cases, supra, this court
held that it was immaterial that trade or commerce had not
actually been restrained-that it made no difference, even,
that rates and prices had been lowered, it being enough to
bring the combination within the condemnation of the act
that it had the power to restrain trade or commerce. The
very existence of the power, under these rulings, constitutes a
restraint.
It is not necessary in order to bring a combination or con-
spiracy within the operation of the act that the members bind
themselves each with the other to do the acts alleged to be in
restraint of trade. It is enough that they act together in
pursuance of a common object, and while, of course, this
presupposes agreement between them in a broad sense, an
agreement or contract in the technical sense is not at all es-
sential. Reg. v. Murphy, 8 C. & P. 397.
A combination or a monopoly, the necessary effect of which
is to restrain trade or commerce, is a violation of the act, and
the aim, motive, intention, or design with which the combina-
tion is entered into or the monopoly created is wholly imma-
terial and outside the question. It may have been to aid and
further commerce rather than to restrain it; but if in point of
law the effect or the tendency of the combination is to restrain
trade or commerce the combination is unlawful, and the motive
behind it, however beneficent, does not alter that fact in the

& 0. Fuel Co. v. United States, 115 Fed. Rep. 623.
A combination or monopoly of competing lines of interstate
railway-of competing instrumentalities of interstate com-
merce-is a combination or monopoly in restraint of interstate
commerce within the prohibition of the act. The transporta-
tion of persons and things is commerce and if a combination
or monopoly of such transportation is a combination or
monopoly in restraint of commerce within the act, and
hence illegal,.it follows as a corollary that a combination or
monopoly of the means or instrumentalities of transportation
is likewise a combination or monopoly in restraint of com-
merce, because a monopoly of the means of transportation
leads directly and inevitably to a monopoly of transportation
itself.
Again, a monopoly of the means of transportation puts it in
the power of the monopolist to stifle competition in the business
of transportation, and a combination or monopoly which had
the power to stifle competition in the business of transportation
among the States is in restraint of interstate commerce and
therefore illegal.
From still another standpoint, Congress may prohibit, and
has prohibited, combinations and monopolies in the business
of interstate and international transportation. But what does
this power amount to if Congress may not also prohibit mo-
nopolies of the means and instrumentalities of such transporta-
tion-of the roads themselves? Virtually nothing; for he who
has a monopoly of the means of transportation has a mo-
nopoly of transportation itself. See the Trans-M11issouri
Case, Joint Traffic Case and Pearsall Case, supra.
The Anti-Trust Act prohibiting combinations and monopo-
lies in restraint of interstate and foreign commerce is an exer-
cise of the power granted to Congress to regulate commerce,
Champion v. Ames, 188 U. S. 321, and the term "commerce"
as used in that grant embraces the instrumentalities by which
commerce is or may be carried on. Railroad Co. v. Fuller,
