NORTHERN SECURITIES CO. v. UNITED STATES. 377
193 U. S. WHITE, J., The CHIEF JusTICE, PEcKH,&m, HoLmEs, JJ., dissenting.
The decisions of this court to my mind leave no room for
doubt on the subject. As I have already shown, the very
definition of the power to regulate commerce, as announced
in Gibbons v. Ogden, excludes the conception that it extends
to stock ownership. I shall not stop to review a multitude
of decisions of this court concerning interstate commerce,
which, whilst upholding the paramount authority of Congress
over that subject, at the same time treated it as elementary,
that the effect of the power over commerce between the States
was not to deprive the States of their right to legislate con-
cerning the ownership of property of every character or to
create railroad corporations and to endow them with such
powers as were deemed appropriate, or to deprive the indi-
vidual of his freedom to acquire, own and enjoy property by
descent, contract or otherwise, because railroads or other
property might become the subject of interstate commerce.
In Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, the question was as to the
power of the State of Virginia to license a foreign insurance
company, and one of the contentions considered was whether
the contract of insurance, since it was related to commerce,
was within the regulating power of Congress and not of the
State of Virginia. The proposition was disposed of in the
following language (p. 183):
"Issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of com-
merce. The policies are simply contracts of indemnity against
loss by fire, entered into between the corporations and the
assured, for a consideration paid by the latter. These con-
tracts are not articles of commerce in any proper meaning of
the word. They are not subjects of trade and barter offered
in the market as something having an existence and value
independent of the parties to them. They are not commodi-
ties to be shipped or forwarded from one State to another, and
then put up for sale. They are like other personal contracts
between parties which are completed by their signature and
the transfer of the consideration. Such contracts are not
interstate transactions, though the parties may be domiciled

in different States. The policies do not take effect-are not
executed contracts-until delivered by the agent in Virginia.
They are, then, local transactions, and are governed by the
local law. They do not constitute a part of the commerce
between the States any more than a contract for the purchase
and sale of goods in Virginia by a citizen of New York whilst
in Virginia would constitute a portion of such commerce."
In other words, the court plainly pointed out the distinction
between interstate commerce as such and the contracts con-
cerning, or the ownership of property which might become the
subjects of interstate commerce. And the authority of Paul
v. Virginia has been repeatedly approved in subsequent cases,
whioh are so familiar as not to require citation.
In Railroad Co. v. Maryland, 21 Wall. 456, the question was
this: The State of Mlaryland had chartered the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad Company, and in the charter had imposed upon
it the duty of paying to the State a certain proportion of all its
receipts from freight, which applied as well to interstate as
domestic freight. The argument was that these provisions
were repugnant to the commerce clause, because they neces-
sarily increased the sum which the railroad would have to
charge, and thereby constituted a regulation of commerce.
The court held the law not to be repugnant to the Constitution,
and in the course of the opinion said (p. 473):
"In view, however, of the very plenary powers which a
State has always been conceded to have over its own territory,
its highways, its franchises and its corporations, we cannot
regard the stipulation in question as amounting to either of
these unconstitutional acts."
True it is that some of the expressions used in the opinion
in the case just cited, giving rise to the inference that there
was power in the State to regulate the rates of freight on inter-
state commerce, may be considered as having been overruled
by Wabash Railroad Company v. Illinois, 118 IT. S. 557. But
that case also in the fullest manner pointed out the fact that
the power to regulate commerce, conferred on Congress by the

Constitution, related not to the mere ownership of property
or to contracts concerning property, because such property
might subsequently be used in interstate commerce or become
the subject of it. For instance, the definition given of inter-
state commerce in Gibbons v. Ogden, previously referred to,
was reiterated and in addition the definition expounded in
County of Mobile v. Kimball, 102 U. S. 691, was approvingly
quoted. That definition was as follows (p. 574):
" 'Commerce with foreign countries and among the States,
strictly construed, consists in intercourse and traffic, including
in these terms navigation and the transportation and transit
of persons and property, as well as the purchase, sale and
exchange of commodities. For the regulation of commerce
as thus defined there can be only one system of rules, applicable
alike to the whole country; and the authority which can act for
the whole country can alone adopt such a system. Action
upon it by separate States is not, therefore, permissible. Lan-
guage affirming the exclusiveness of the grant of power over
commerce as thus defined may not be inaccurate, when it would
be so if applied to legislation upon subjects which are merely
auxiliary to conmerce.' "
In Ashley v. Ryan, 153 U. S. 436, this was the question:
The property of various railroad corporations operating in the
States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri had
been sold under decrees of foreclosure. The purchasers of the
respective lines availed themselves of the Ohio statutes, and
consolidated all the corporations into one so as to form a single
system, the Wabash. On presenting the articles of consolida-
tion to the Secretary of State of Ohio, that officer demanded
a fee imposed by the Oiio statutes, predicated upon the sum
total of the capital stock of the consolidated company. This
was refused on the ground that the State of Ohio had no right
to make the charge, and that its doing so was repugfhant to the
commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States and
to the Fourteenth Amendment. This court decided against
this contention. It held that, as the right to consolidate could
