that the result of the transactions disclosed by the pleadings and
proof was the creation of a monopoly in the manufacture of a
necessary of life. If this combination, so far as its operations
necessarily or directly affect interstate commerce, cannot be
restrained or suppressed under some power granted to Con-
gress, it will be cause for regret that the patriotic statesmen
who framed the Constitution did not foresee the necessity of
investing the national government with power to deal with
gigantic monopolies holding in their grasp, and injuriously con-
trolling in their own interest, the entire trade among the States
m food products that are essential to the comfort of every
household in the land.
The court holds it to be vital in our system of government
to recognize and give effect to both the commercial power of
the nation and the police powers of the States, to the end
that. the Union be strengthened and the autonomy of the
States preserved. In this view I entirely concur. "Un-
doubtedly, the preservation.of the just authority of the States
is an object of deep concern to every lover of his country
NVo greater calamity could befall our free institutions than the
destruction of that authority, by whatever means such a result
might be accomplished. "Without the States in union," this
court has said, "there could be no such political body as the
United States." Lane County v Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76. But
it is equally true that the preservation of the just authority of
the General Government is essential as well to the safety of
the States as to the attainment of the important ends for
which that government was ordained by the People of the
United States, and the destruction of that authority would be
fatal to the peace and well-being of the American people.
The Constitution which enumerates the powers committed to
the nation for objects of interest to the .people of all the
States should not, therefore, be subjected *to an interpretation
so rigid, technical, and narrow, that those objects cannot be
accomplished. Learned counsel in Gibbons v Ogden, 9 Wheat.
1, 187, having suggested that the Constitution should be strictly
construed, this court, speaking by Chief Justice Marshall, said
that when the original States "converted their league into a

government,when they converted their Congress of Ambassa-
dors, deputed to deliberate on their common concerns, and to
recommend measures of general utility, into a legislature em-
powered to enact laws on the most 'interesting subjects, the
whole character in which the States appear underwent a
change, the extent of which must be determined by a fair
consideration of the instrument by which that change was
effected." "What do gentlemen mean," the court inquired,
"by a strict construction 2 If they contend only against that
enlarged construction, which would extend words beyond
their natural and obvious import, one might question the
application of the term, but should not controvert the prin-
ciple. If they contend for that narrow construction which, in
support of some theory not to be found in the Constitution,
would deny to the government those powers which the words
of the grant, as usually understood, import, and which are
consistent with the general views and objects of the instru-
ment -for that narrow construction, which would cripple the
government, and render it unequal to the objects for which it
is declared to be instituted, and to which the powers given,
as fairly understood, render it competent - then we cannot
perceive the propriety of this strict construction, nor adopt it
as the rule by which the Constitution is to be expounded."
p. 188. On the same occasion the principle was announced
that the objects for which a power was granted to Congress,
especially when those objects are expressed in the Constitu-
tion itself, should have great influence in determining the
extent of any given power.
Congress is invested with power to regulate commerce with
foreign nations and among the several States. The power to
regulate is the power to prescribe the rule by which the sub-
ject regulated is to be governed. It is one that must be exer-
cised whenever necessary throughout the territorial limits of
the several States. Cokens v l'irgmnit, 6 Wheat. 264, 413.
The power to make these regulations "is complete in itself,
may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no
limitations, other than are prescribed in the Constitution." It
is plenary because vested in Congress "as absolutely as it

would be in a single government having in its constitution the
same restrictions on the exercise of the power as are found in
the Constitution of the United States." It may be exercised
"whenever the subject exists." Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1,
195, 196. In his concurring opinion in that case, Mr. Justice
Johnson observed that the grant to Congress of the power to
regulate commerce carried with it the whole subject, leaving
nothing for the State to act upon, and that "if there was any
one object riding over every other in the adoption of the Con-
stitution, it was to keep commercial intercourse among the
States free from all invidious and partial restraints." p. 231.
"In all commercial regulations we are one and the same
people." Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for this court, said
that the United States are but one country, and are and must
be subject to one system of xegulations in respect to interstate
commerce. 1?obbzns v. Shelby Taxnng Dwstmct, 120 U S. 489,
494.
What is commerce among the States 2 The decisions of this
court fully answer the question. "Commerce, undoubtedly,
is traffic, but it is something more it is intercourse. It does
not embrace the completely interior traffic of the respective
States -that which is "carried on between man and man in a
State, or between different parts of the same State and which
does not extend to or affect other States" -but it does em-
brace "every species of commercial intercourse" between the
United States and foreign nations and among the States, and,
therefore, it includes such traffic or trade, buying, selling, and
interchange of commodities, as directly affects or necessarily
involves the interests of the People of the United States.
"Commerce, as the word is used in the Constitution, is a
unit," and "cannot stop at the external boundary line of each
State, but may be introduced into the interior." "The genius
and character of the whole government seem to be, that its
action is to be applied to all the external concerns of the
nation, and to those -n.ternal concerns whsch affect the States
generally."
These principles were announced in Gibbons v Ogden, and
have often been approved. It is the settled doctrine of this
