Statement of the- Case.
with the approval of the managers, and no one that the man-
agers decided to be objectionable was to be employed or con-
tinued in an agency. The' ofcials and employ~s of any of
the companies could be examined, and an investigation made
when, in the judgment of the managers, their information or
any complaint might so warrant. Any violation of the agree-
ment was to be followed by a forfeiture of the offending com-
pany in a sum to be determined by the managers, which
should not exceed five thousand dollars, or if the gross receipts
of the transaction which violated the agreement should exceed
five thousand dollars, the offending party should, in the dis-
cretion of the managers, fbrfeit a sum not exceeding such
gross receipts. The sums thus collected were to go to the pay-
ment of the expenses of the association, except that the offend-
ing company should not participate in the application of its
own forfeiture.
The agreement also provided for assessments upon the com-
panies in order to pay the expenses of ihe association, and also
for the appointment of commissioners and abitrators who were
to decide matters coming before them. No one retiring from
the agreement before the time fixed for its final completion,
except by the unanimous consent of the parties, should be Pn-
titled to any refund from the residue of the deposits remain-
ing at the close of-the agreement.
It was to take effect January 1, 1896; and to continue in ex-
istence five years, after which any company could retire upon
giving ninety days' written notice of its desire to do so.
The bill fil6d by the Government contained allegations
showing that all the defendant railroad companies were com-
mon carriers'duly incorporated by the several States through
which they passed, and that they were engaged as such carriers
in the transportation of freight and passengers, separately or
in connection with each other, in trade and commerce contin-
uously carried on among the several States of the Union and
between the several States and the Territories thereof. The bill
also charged that the defendants, unlawfully intending to re-
strain commerce among the several States and to prevent com-
petition among the railroads named, in respect to all their

interstate commerce, entered into the agreement referred to
above, and it charged that the agreement was an unlawful
one, and a combination and conspiracy, and that it was en-
tered into in order to terminate all competition among the
parties to it for freight and passenger traffic, and that the
agreement unlawfully restrained trade and commerce among
the several States and Territories of the United States, and
unlawfully attempted to monopolize a part of such interstate
trade and commerce. The bill ended with the allegation that,
the companies were preparing to put into full operation all
the provisions of the agreement, and the relief sought was a
judgment declaring the agreement void and enjoining the
parties from operating their roads under the same. The de-
fendant, the Joint Traffic Association, filed an answer (the
other defendants substantially adopting it), which admitted
the making of the contract, but denied its invalidity or that ft
is or was intended to be an unlawful contract, combination or
conspiracy to restrain trade or commerce, or that it was an
attempt to monopolize the same, or that it was intended to
restrain or prevent legitimate competition among the railroads
which were parties to the agreement. The answer, in brief,
denied all allegations of unlawful acts or of an unlawful in-
tent, unless the making of the agreement itself was an unlaw-
ful act. The answer then set forth in quite lengthy terms
a general history of the condition of the railroad traffic among
the various railroads which were parties to the agreement at
the time it was entered into, and alleged the necessity of
some such agreement in order to the harmonious operation of
the different roads, and that it was necessary as well to the
public as to the railroads themselves.
The case came on for hearing on bill and answer, and the
Circuit Court, after a hearing, dismissed the bill, and upon
appeal its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit, and the Government has appealed here.
Mr. Solicitor Generat for appellants.
The agreement violates the auti-trust law, because it create&
an association of competing trunk line systems, to which is.

given jurisdiction over competitive interstate traffic, with power,
through a central authority, aided by a skilful scheme of re-
strictions, regulations and penalies, to establish and maintain
rates and fares on such traffic and prevent competition, thus
constituting a contract in restraint of trade or commerce
among the several States, as defined by this court in the
Trans-Missouric ase, 166 U. S. 290.
That case was elaborately argued and carefully considered.
A petition for a rehearing was presented and denied. The
decision has been accepted and acted upon by the Depart-
ments of the Government, and by the courts, both state and
Federal, as definitively settling the meaning and scope of the
anti-trust law when applied to traffic associations among com-
peting interstate railway systems. The decision was not only
a just, but an eminently salutary.one. I shall not concede that
the principles it laid down remain questionable. I shall not
admit that it is necessary for me, by argument, to fortify the
position taken by this court in that case. The anti-trust law,
as there construed, is the law of the land.
The wisdom of Congress in prohibiting all agreements in
restraint of trade among interstate railway systems is even
more manifest now than when the Trans-Missouri case was
decided. At the time of the argument of the Trans-Missouri
case, it was still to some extent a mooted question whether
the Interstate Commerce Commission -was empowered to de-
termine what are fair and reasonable rates, and to enforce
such rates. This question is no longer open. Interstate Com-

If it be urged that any illegality in the "agreement is cured
by section 3 of article 7, providing that "the powers conferred
upon the managers shall be so construed and exercised as not
to permit violation of the Interstate Commerce adt, or any
other law applicable to the premises, or any provision of the
