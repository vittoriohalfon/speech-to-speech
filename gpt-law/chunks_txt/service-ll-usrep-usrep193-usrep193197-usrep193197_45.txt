conspiracy? How far may Congress go in regulating the af-
fairs or conduct of state corporations engaged as carriers in
commerce among the States or of state corporations which,
although not directly engaged themselves in such commerce,
yet have control of the business of interstate carriers? If state
corporations, or their stockholders, are found to be parties to
a combination, in the form of a trust or otherwise, which re-
strains interstate or international commerce, may they not be
compelled to respect any rule for such commerce that may be
lawfully prescribed by Congress?
These questions were earnestly discussed at the bar by able
counsel, and have received the full consideration which their
importance demands.
The first case in this court arising under the Anti-Trust Act
was United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1. The next
case was that of United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight As-
sociation, 166 U. S. 290. That was followed by United States
v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 U. S. 505, Hopkins v. United
States, 171 U. S. 578, Anderson v. United States, 171 U. S.
604, Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U. S.
211, and Montague & Co. v. Lowry, 193 U. S. 38. To these
may be added Pearsall v. Great Northern Railway, 161 U. S.
646, which, although not arising under the Anti-Trust Act, in-
volved an agreement under which the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific Railway companies should be consolidated
and by which competition between those companies was to
cease. In United States v. E. C. Knight Co., it was held that
the agreement or arrangement there involved had reference
only to the manufacture or production of sugar by those en-
gaged in the alleged combination, but if it had directly em-
braced interstate or international commerce, it would then
have been covered by the Anti-Trust Act and would have been
illegal; in United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Associa-
tion, that an agreement between certain railroad companies
providing for establishing and maintaining, for their mutual
protection, reasonable rates, rules and regulations in respect

of freight traffic, through and local, and by which free coni-
petition among those companies was restricted, was, by rea-
son of such restriction, illegal under the Anti-Trust Act; in
United States v. Joint Traffic Association, that an arrange-
ment between certain railroad companies in reference to rail-
road traffic among the States, by which the railroads involved
were not subject to competition among themselves, was also
forbidden by the act; in Hopkins v. United States and An-
derson v. United States, that the act embraced only agreements
that had direct connection with interstate commerce, and that
such commerce comprehended intercourse for all the purposes
of trade, in any and all its forms, including the transporta-
tion, purchase, sale and exchange of commodities between citi-
zens of different States, and the power to regulate it embraced
all the instrumentalities by which such commerce is conducted;
in Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, all the members
of the court concurring, that the act of Congress made illegal
an agreement between certain private companies or corpora-
tions engaged in different States in the manufacture, sale and
transportation of iron pipe, whereby competition among them
was avoided, was covered by the Anti-Trust Act; and in Mon-
tague v. Lowry, all the members of the court again concurring,
that a combination created by an agreement between certain
private manufacturers and dealers in tiles, grates and man-
tels, in different States, whereby they controlled or sought to
control the price of such articles in those States, was con-
demned by the act of Congress. In Pearsall v. Great North-
ern Railway, which, as already stated, involved the consolida-
tion of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway
companies, the court said: "The consolidation of these two
great corporations will unavoidably result in giving to the de-
fendant [the Great Northern] a monopoly of all traffic in the
northern half of the State of Minnesota, as well as of all trans-
continental traffic north of the line of the Union Pacific, against
which public regulations will be but a feeble protection. The
acts of the Minnesota Legislature of 1874 and 1881 undoubtedly

reflected the general sentiment of the public, that their best
security is in competition."
We will not incumber this opinion by extended extracts from
the former opinions of this court. It is sufficient to say that
from the decisions in the above cases certain propositions are
plainly deducible and embrace the present case. Those prop-
ositions are:
That although the act of Congress known as the Anti-Trust
Act has no reference to the mere manufacture or production of
articles or commodities within the limits of the several States,
it does embrace and declare to be illegal every contract, com-
bination or conspiracy, in whatever form, of whatever nature,
and whoever may be parties to it, which directly or necessarily
operates in restraint of trade or commerce among the several
States or with foreign nations;
That the act is not limited to restraints of interstate and in-
ternational trade or commerce that are unreasonable in their
nature, but embraces all direct restraints imposed by any com-
bination, conspiracy or monopoly upon such trade or commerce:
That railroad carriers engaged in interstate or international
trade or commerce are embraced by the act;
That combinations even among private manufacturers or
dealers, whereby interstate or international commerce is re-
strained are equally embraced by the act;
That Congress has the power to establish rules by which in-
terstate and internationalc ommerce shall be governed, and, by
the Anti-Trust Act, has prescribed the rule of free competition
among those engaged in such commerce;
That every combination or conspiracy which would extin-
guish competition between otherwise competing railroads en-
gaged in interstate trade or commerce, and which would in that
way restrain such trade or commerce, is made illegal by the act;
That the natural effect of competition is to increase com-
merce, and an agreement whose direct effect is to prevent this
play of competition restrains instead of promotes trade and
commerce;
