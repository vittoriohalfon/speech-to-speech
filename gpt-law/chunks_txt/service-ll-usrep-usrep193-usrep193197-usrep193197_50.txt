described in the bill? All will agree that if the Anti-Trust Act
be constitutional, and if the combination in question be in
violation, of its provisions, the courts may enforce the pro-
visions of the statute by such orders and decrees as are neces-
sary or appropriate to that end and as may be consistent with
the fundamental rules of legal procedure. And all, we take it,
will agree, as established firmly by the decisions of this court,
that the power of Congress over commerce extends to all the
instrumentalities of such commerce, and to every device that
may be employed to interfere with the freedom of commerce
among the States and with foreign nations. Equally, we
assume, all will agree that the Constitution and the legal
enactments of Congress are, by express words of the Consti-
tution, the supreme law of the land, anything in the constitu-
tion and laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.
Nevertheless, the defendants, strangely enough, invoke in their
behalf the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution which de-
clares that "the powers not delegated to the United States by
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are re-
served to the States respectively or to the People;" and we
are confronted with the suggestion that any order or decree
of the Federal court which will prevent the Northern Se-
curities Company from exercising the power it acquired in
becoming the holder of the stocks of the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific Railway companies will be an invasion of
the rights of the State under which the Securities Company
was chartered, as well as of the rights of the States creating the
other companies. In other words, if the State of New Jersey
gives a charter to a corporation, and even if the obtaining of
such charter is in fact pursuant to a combination under which
it becomes the holder of the stocks of shareholders in two coni-
peting, parallel railroad companies engaged in interstate com-
merce in other States, whereby competition between the re-
spective roads of those companies is to be destroyed and the
enormous commerce carried on over them restrained by sup-
pressing competition, Congress must stay its hands and allow

such restraint to continue to the detriment of the public
because, forsooth, the corporations concerned or some of them
are state corporations. We cannot conceive how it is possible
for any one to seriously contend for such a proposition. It
means nothing less than that Congress, in regulating interstate
commerce, must act in subordination to the will of the States
when exerting their power to create corporations. No such
view can be entertained for a moment.
It is proper to say in passing that nothing in the record
tends to show that the State of New Jersey had any reason to
suspect that those who took advantage of its liberal incorpora-
tion laws had in view, when organizing the Securities Company,
to destroy competition between two great railway carriers
engaged in interstate commerce in distant States of the Union.
The purpose of the combination was concealed under very
general words that gave no clue whatever to the real purposes
of those who brought about the organization of the Securities
Company. If the certificate of the incorporation of that com-
pany had expressly stated that the object of the company was
to destroy competition between competing, parallel lines of
interstate carriers, all would have seen, at the outset, that the
scheme was in hostility to the national authority, and that
there was a purpose to violate or evade the act of Congress.
We reject any such view of the relations of the National
Government and the States composing the Union, as that for
which the defendants contend. Such a view cannot be main-
tained without destroying the just authority of the United
States. It is inconsistent with all the decisions of this court
as to the powers of the National Government over matters
committed to it. No State can, by merely creating a corpo-
ration, or in any other mode, project its authority into other
States, and across the continent, so as to prevent Congress from
exerting the power it possesses under the Constitution over
interstate and international commerce, or so as to exempt its
corporation engaged in interstate commerce from obedience
to any rule lawfully established by Congress for such com-

merce. It cannot be said that any State may give a corpora-
tion, created under its laws, authority to restrain interstate
or international commerce against the will of the nation as
lawfully expressed by Congress. Every corporation created
by a State is necessarily subject to the supreme law of the
land. And yet the suggestion is made that to restrain a state
corporation from interfering with the free course of trade and
commerce among the States, in violation of an act of Congress,
is hostile to the reserved rights of the States. The Federal
court may not have power to forfeit the charter of the Se-
curities Company; it may not declare how its shares of stock
may be transferred on its books, nor prohibit it from acquiring
real estate, nor diminish or increase its capital stock. All
these and like matters are to be regulated by the State which
created the company. But to the end that effect be given to
the national will, lawfully expressed, Congress may prevent
that company, in its capacity as a holding corporation and
trustee, from carrying out the purposes of a combination
formed in restraint of interstate commerce. The Securities
Company is itself a part of the present combination; its head
and front; its trustee. It would be extraordinary if the court,
in executing the act of Congress, could not lay hands upon that
company and prevent it from doing that which, if done, will
defeat the act of Congress. Upon like grounds the court can,
by appropriate orders, prevent the two competing railroad
companies here involved from co6perating with the Securities
Company in restraining commerce among the States. In
short, the court may make any order necessary to bring about
the dissolution or suppression of an illegal combination that
restrains interstate commerce. All this can be done without
infringing in any degree upon the just authority of the States.
The affirmance of the judgment below will only mean that no
combination, however powerful, is stronger than the law or
will be permitted to avail itself of the pretext that to prevent
it doing that which, if done, would defeat a legal enactment
of Congress, is to attack the reserved rights of the States. It
