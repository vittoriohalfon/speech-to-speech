200 OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Bill in Equity. 193 U. S.
By MR. JUSTICE BREWER.
The act of July 2, 1890, was leveled, as appears by its title, at only unlawful
restraints and monopolies. Congress did not intend to reach and de-
stroy those minor contracts in partial restraint of trade which tile long
course of decisions at common law had affirmed were reasonable and
ought to be upheld.
The general language of the act is limited by the power which each indi-
vidual has to manage his own property and determine the place and
manner of its investment. Freedom of action in these respects is among
the inalienable rights of every citizen.
A corporation, while by fiction of law recognized for some purposes as a
person and for purposes of jurisdiction as a citizen, is not endowed with
the inalicnable rights of a natural person, but it is an artificial pelson,
created and existing only for the convenient transaction of business.
Where, however, no individual investment is involved, but there is a coin-
bination by several individuals separately owning stock in two competing
railroad companies engaged in interstate commerce, to place the control
of both in a single corporation, which is organized for that purpose ex-
pressly and as a mere instrumentality by which the competing railroa(
can be combined, the resulting combination is a direct restraint of trade
by destroying competition, and is illegal within the meaning of the let
of July 2, 1890.
A suit brought by the Attorney General of the United States to declare this
combination illegal under the act of July 2, 1890, is not ,n interference
with the control of the States under which the railroad companies and the
holding company were, respectively, organized.
THE pleadings in this action and the decree of the Circuit
Court are as follows:
