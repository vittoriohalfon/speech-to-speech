and they alleged that that act and the amendments consti-
tuted a system of regulations established by Congress for
common carriers subject to the act, and they denied that they
were subject to the provisions of the act of Congress passed
July 2, 1890, above set forth.
They admit that they severally own, control and operate
separate and distinct lines of railroad constructed and fitted
for carrying on business as common carriers of freight, inde-
pendently and disconnectedly with each other; except that a
common interest exists between certain companies, named in
the answer. They admit that the lines of railroad mentioned
in the bill furnish lines of transportation and communication
to persons engaged in freight traffic between and among the
States and Territories of the United States, having through
lines for freight traffic in that region of country lying to the
westward of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and east of
the Pacific Ocean, but deny that they are the only such lines,
and allege that there are several others, naming them.
They further admitted that prior to the organization of the
freight association the defendants furnished to the public and
to persons engaged in trade, traffic-and commerce between
the several States and Territories named in the agreement,
separate, distinct and competitive lines of transportation and
communication, and they allege that they still continue to
do so.
They admitted that some of the roads mentioned in the
bill received. aid by land grants from the United States, and
others received aid from States and Territories by loans of
credits, donations of depot sites and rights of way, and in a
few cases by investments of money, and that the people of
the States and Territories to a limited extent made invest-
ments in thestocks and bonds of some of the roads, while
others, mentioned in the bill, were almost exclusively con-
structed by capital furnished by non-residents of that region.
It was also admitted that the purpose of the land grants,
loans, donations and investments was to obtain the construc-
tion of competitive lines of transportation and communication
to the end that the public and the people engaged in trade

Statement of the Case.
and commerce throughout that region of country might have
facilities afforded by railways in communicating with each
other and with other portion of the United States and the
world, and denied that they were granted for any other
purpose.
The defendants admitted the formation on or about March
15, 1889, of the voluntary association described in the bill as
the "Trans-Missouri Freight Association."
They denied the allegation that they were not content with
the rates and prices prevailing at the date of the agreement;
they denied any intent to unjustly increase rates, and denied
that the agreement destroyed, prevented or illegally limited
or influenced competition; they denied that arbitrary rates
were fixed or charged, or that rates had been increased, or
that the effect of free competition had been counteracted;
they denied any purpose in the formation of the association
to monopolize trade, traffic and commerce between the States
and Territories within the region mentioned in the bill; and
they denied that the agreement was in any respect the illegal
result of any unlawful confederation or conspiracy. The de-
fendants alleged that the proper object of the association was
to establish reasonable rates, rules and regulations on all
freight traffic, and the maintenance of such rates until
changed in the manner provided by law; that the agree-
ment was filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission
as required by section 6 of the act of February 4, 1887.
They also alleged that it was not the purpose of the associa-
tion to prevent the members from reducing rates or changing
the rules and regulations fixed by the association; that by
the terms of the agreement each member might do so, the
preliminary requirement being that the proposed change
should be voted upon at a meeting of the association, after
which, if the proposal was not agreed to, the line making the
proposal could make such reduced rate notwithstanding the
objection of the other lines; that the purpose of this provision
was to afford opportunity for the consideration of the reason-
ableness of any proposed rate, rule or regulation by all lines
interested and an interchange of views on the effect of such

reduction, and that reductions of rates had been made in
numerous instances through said process by the association.
They admitted that the agreement took effect April 1, 1889,
and that it had remained in operation since, and that the
rates, rules and regulations fixed and established from time
to time under said agreement had been put into effect and
maintained in conformity to law; and it was denied that by
reason of the agreement or under duress of fines and penal-
ties, or otherwise, the defendants had refused to establish and
maintain just and reasonable rates; and it was alleged that
the object of the association at all times had been and was
to establish all rates, rules and regulations upon a just and
reasonable basis, and to avoid unjust discrimination and undue
preference. They denied that shippers or the public were in
any way oppressed or injured by reason of the rates fixed by
the association, but on the contrary they alleged that the
agreement and the association established under it had been
beneficial to the patrons of the railway lines composing the
association and the public at large. These in substance were
the allegations in- the various answers.
The cause came on for hearing on bill and answer before
the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Kan-
sas, First Division. That court dismissed the bill without
costs against the complainant. 53 Fed. Rep. 440. The Gov-
ernment duly appealed from the judgment to the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and that
court after argument affirmed, in October, 1893, the judgment
of the Circuit Court, without costs, Shiras, District Judge, dis-
senting. 19 U. S. App. 36. From that judgment the Govern-
ment appealed to this court.
A motion was made upon affidavits to dismiss the appeal.
The affidavits show that on the 18th of November, 1892, a
resolution was adopted by the Trans-Missouri Freight Associa-
tion, one of the defendants, providing that the organization
should be discontinued from and after the 19th of November,
1892, and the secretary was instructed to wind up its affairs
at as early a date as possible. It further appeared by the
affidavits that the Trans-Missouri Freight Association was
