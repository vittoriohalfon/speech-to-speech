It must be remembered that the monopoly complained of is
a monopoly of railway traffic resulting from centering in a
single body controlling stock interests in two competing rail-
ways, and whatever may be the power of Congress or state
legislatures over monopolies in general, they may unques-
tionably, in the exercise of their broad regulative powers
over quasi-public corporations, prohibit any monopoly of
railway transportation within their respective spheres of
action.
As to the contention that the transaction is simply a sale of
stock to an investor and to stamp it as illegal would be an
unwarranted infringement upon the right of contract, and that
the Securities Company never intended to take any active
part in the controlling of the two companies, the argument is
not sincere and it is demonstrated by the testimony of the
individual defendants that the Securities Company was the
designed instrument for directing and controlling the policies
of the competing lines.
As to the circular of Mr. Hill to the stockholders, it is well
settled that because a person has the right to purchase stock
it does not follow that stockholders of two or more compet-
ing corporations can combine among themselves and with such
person to sell him their stock and induce others to do the same,
so as to center the controlling stock interests of the several
corporations in a single head, in violation of statutes against
combinations, consolidations, and monopolies. Noyes on
Intercorp. Rel. ยง 36; Perna. R. Co. v. Corn., 7 Atl. Rep.

This distinction between an actual bona fide sale, and one
which is merely nominal and really a cloak under which to
accomplish a combination sometimes leads to confusion of
language or thought. See Trenton Potteries Co. v. Olyphant,
58 N. J. Eq. 507; Noyes on Intercorp. Rel. ยง 354.
As to the argument of the appellants that the "acquiescence
by the Government for more than eleven years in the merger
and consolidation of many important parallel and competing

lines of railroad and steamships engaged in interstate com-
merce and foreign commerce has given a practical construction
to the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890, to the effect that it was
not intended to forbid and does not forbid the natural processes
of unification which are brought about under modern methods
of lease, consolidation, merger, community of interest, or
ownership of stock," there is no force whatever to the con-
tention which the court below evidently deemed too flimsy
even to refer to. But the answer to it is threefold-the case
of a company formed for the purpose of holding stocks of two
competing lines of interstate railways is a new one and arose
for the first time in this case; the 'constitutionality of the act
and its application to railroads was not settled until 1898 by
the decision of Trans-Missouria nd Joint Traffic Cases, supra;
even if there had been acquiescence as to certain combinations
it would not amount to an estoppel against the Government
for prosecuting this action. Louisville & Nashville v. Ken-
tucky, 161 U. S. 677, 689.
The combination and monopoly charged by the United
States operate directly on interstate commerce, and do not
affect it only indirectly, incidentally, or remotely. Noyes on
Intercorp. Rel. ยง 392, and authorities there cited.
The question in this case is not whether the means by which
the power of the combination is brought into play are direct
or indirect, but whether the combination itself, whenever its
power has been brought into play-it matters not how indirect
may have been the means employed in bringing it into play-
operates directly on interstate or international commerce.
The failure of the defendants' counsel to bear this in mind has
led them to make very elaborate arguments to show that the
combination charged by the Government affects interstate
commerce only indirectly and remotely. In reply to the con-
tention on this point, see opinion of the court below, after
citing United States v. E. C. Knight Company, 156 U. S. 1;
Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578; Anderson v. United
States, 171 U. S. 604, on which counsel for defendants rely,

properly held that no combination could more immediately
affect such commerce.
The relief granted by the Circuit Court was authorized by
section 4 of the Anti-Trust Act.
The gist of the Government's charge being that a combina-
tion of the two railway companies has been formed by centering
the title to a majority of their respective shares in the Se-
curities Company, which by obtaining such majority of both
stocks has acquired a monopoly-all in violation of the Anti-
Trust Act and as unlawful combination and monopoly exists
solely by virtue of the Securities Company's ownership of such
majorities the logical and most direct way to destroy the com-
bination and monopoly and prevent the continued violation
of the statute is to strip such ownership, which was acquired in
pursuance of an illegal object, of its powers and incidents-
to disarm it of its power to violate the law. And this is what
the Circuit Court did. Clearly this decree violates no rights
of property which the Securities Company or any of the other
defendants is entitled to claim.
It is proper to grant this relief even though the purpose of
the company had already been accomplished. The combina-
tion charged by the Government is a combination of the two
railways, formed by concentrating in the Securities Company
the power to control both roads. This combination did not
"come to an end," did not "accomplish its purpose," with
the organization of the Securities Company, and therefore the
violation of the Anti-Trust Act did not "come to an enl"
there, but continued on without interruption, and under the
act the Circuit Courts can prevent, restrain, enjoin or other-
wise prohibit violations thereof, and are left free to frame their
remedial process to meet the exigencies of the case, and ais
courts of equity they enjoy the same wide latitude in formula-
ting relief in cases of this class that they enjoy in any other
class of cases within the jurisdiction of equity. Taylor v.
Simon, 4 Mylne & Craig, 141; Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v.
Union Pacific Ry. Co., 47 Fed. Rep. 15, 26.
