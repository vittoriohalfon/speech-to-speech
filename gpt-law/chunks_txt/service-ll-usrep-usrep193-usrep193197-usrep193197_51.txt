would mean that the Government which represents all, can,
when acting within the limits of its powers, compel obedience
to its authority. It would mean that no device in evasion of
its provisions, however skillfully such device may have been
contrived, and no combination, by whomsoever formed, is
beyond the reach of the supreme law of the land, if such device
or combination by its operation directly restrains commerce
among the States or with foreign nations in violation of the
act of Congress.
The defendants rely, with some confidence, upon the case
of Railroad Company v. Maryland, 21 Wall. 456, 473.
But nothing we have said is inconsistent with any principle
announced in that case. The court there recognized the
principle that a State has plenary powers "over its own terri-
tory, its highways, its franchises, and its corporations," and
observed that "we are bound to sustain the constitutional
powers and prerogatives of the States, as well as those of the
United States, whenever they are brought before us for adju-
dication, no matter what may be the consequences." Of
course, every State has, in a general sense, plenary power over
its corporations. But is it conceivable that a State, when
exerting power over a corporation of its creation, may prevent
or embarrass the exercise by Congress of any power with which
it is invested by the Constitution? In the case just referred
to the court does not say, and it is not to be supposed that it
will ever say, that any power exists in a State to prevent the
enforcement of a lawful enactment of Congress, or to invest
any of its corporations, in whatever business engaged, with
authority to disregard such enactment or defeat its legitimate
operation. On the contrary, the court has steadily held to
the doctrine, vital to the United States as well as to the States,
that a state enactment, even if passed in the exercise of its
acknowledged powers, must yield, in case of conflict, to the
supremacy of the Constitution of the United States and the
acts of Congress efiacted in pursuance of its provisions. This
results, the court has said, as well from the nature of the Gov-

700, 725, the court remarked "that 'the people of each State
compose a State, having its own government, and endowed
with all the functions essential to separate and independent
existence,' and that 'without the States in union, there could
be no such political body as the United States.' County of
Lane v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 76. Not only, therefore, can there
be no loss of separate and independent autonomy to the States,
through their union under the Constitution, but it may be not
unreasonably said that the preservation of the States, and the
maintenance of their governments, are as much within the
design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the
Union and the maintenance of the National Government."
These doctrines are at the basis of our Constitutional Govern-
ment, and cannot be disregarded with safety.
The defendants also rely on Louisville & Nashville Railroad
v. Kentucky, 161 U. S. 677, 702. In that case it was contended
by the railroad company that the assumption of the State to
forbid the consolidation of parallel and competing lines was
an interference with the power of Congress over interstate
commerce. The court observed that but little need be said
in answer to such a proposition, for "it has never been supposed
that the dominant power of Congress over interstate com-
merce took from the States the power of legislation with re-
spect to the instruments of such commerce, so far as the legis-
lation was within its ordinary police powers." But that case
distinctly recognized that there was a division of power be-
tween Congress and the States in respect to interstate railways,
and that Congress had the superior right to control that com-
merce and forbid interference therewith, while to the States
remained the power to create and to regulate the instruments
of such commerce, so far as necessary to the conservation of
the public interests. If there is anything in that case which

even intimates that a State or a state corporation may in any
way directly restrain interstate commerce, over which Con-
gress has, by the Constitution, complete control, we have been
unable to find it.
The question of the relations of the General Government
with the States is again presented by the specific contention
of each defendant that Congress did not intend "to limit the
power of the several States to create corporations, define their
purposes, fix the amount of their capital, and determine who
may buy, own and sell their stock." All that is true, generally
speaking, but the contention falls far short of meeting the
controlling questions in this case. To meet this contention
we must repeat some things already said in this opinion. But
if what we have said be sound, repetition will do no harm.
So far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned,
a State may, indeed, create a corporation, define its powers,
prescribe the amount of its stock and the mode in which it
may be transferred. It may even authorize one of its corpo-
rations to engage in commerce of every kind; domestic, inter-
state and international. The regulation or control of purely
domestic commerce of a State is, of course, with the State, and
Congress has no direct power over it so long as what is done
by the State does not interfere with the operations of the
General Government, or any legal enactment of Congress. A
State, if it chooses so to do, may even submit to the existence
of combinations within its limits that restrain its internal
trade. But neither a state corporation nor its stockholders
can, by reason of the non-action of the State or by means of
any combination among such stockholders, interfere with the
complete enforcement of any rule lawfully devised by Con-
gress for the conduct of commerce among the States or with
foreign nations; for, as we have seen, interstate and interna-
tional commerce is by the Constitution under the control of
Congress, and it belongs to the legislative department of the
Government to prescribe rules for the conduct of that com-
merce. If it were otherwise, the declaration in the Constitu-
