association from changing the rates from local points; the

patrons. The second section prohibits a common carrier from
charging one person more than another for the same service ;
it does not prohibit a carrier from charging one person more
or less than another railroad charges another person for an
equal distance. The third section forbids a common carrier
to give any undue preference or advantage to any person or
locality over any other. But this only applies to the action
of a railroad toward the people or the places served by it.
And so, too, with reference to the long and short haul pro-
visions in the fourth section.
The Interstate Commerce law declares that all charges
must be reasonable and just. It provides no means for secur-
ing this desideratum except competition. The only method
of stifling competition when the law was passed was the pool-
ing agreement, and this was forbidden. Competition between
railroads was preserved, and to secure the benefits of competi-
tion to all patrons of each road it was provided that the com-
petition should be open and above board, so that the people
might be advised of the existing rates, and each railroad was
required to treat its patrons with uniformity, without discrimi-
nation and without preferences.
The object of the law was to secure the benefits of compe-
tition to all, and not permit a road to charge those shippers
for whose patronage it does not have to compete excessive
rates, while secretly granting lower rates to those shippers for
whose patronage it has to compete. The competition was to
be restricted to where it belongs; between the railroads and
not between the shippers. If a railroad can afford to carry
the freight of one shipper for a certain rate, it can afford to
carry for the same rate like freight under similar conditions
for every other shipper.

tained on the trunk lines in order to keep the weaker roads in

operation for the benefit of the sections through which they
run.
As I have pointed out, the agreement does not apply to
local traffic. As to it, each road has a monopoly, with power
to fix its own rates. The agreement applies only to com-
petitive traffic between great centres. The argument, then,
amounts to this, that the rates on through traffic are to be
kept up in order to preserve the weak roads as going concerns
for the benefit of the sections through which they run. What
is this but to tax the many for the benefit of the few? It is
not the function of Government to neutralize the advantages
of locality. The people pay for these and are entitled to
them. If I settle in a flourishing region on a good line, I pay
for the privilege in the cost of the land, in taxes, etc. If I
settle in an undeveloped region on a poor road, I pay little for
either the privilege or the land, and must expect to help bear
the cost of development.
IX. It is said that the Interstate Commerce act was passed
to suppress competition and secure uniformity in rates.
It was not passed to suppress competition, but to preserve
it and secure its benefits to all. Competition between inde-
pendent lines was preserved and uniformity enforced to secure
the benefit of this competition to all. Each carrier was re-
quired to treat its patrons with uniform fairness, without
preference and without discrimination. The only effective
arrangement used at that time by the trunk lines to stifle
competition was the pooling agreement, and this was prohib-
ited. It was recognized that competition would keep the
rates reasonable, and the long'and short haul provision was
intended to secure to all points on each road the benefit of
such competition. Unjust discrimination and undue pref-
erences by a railroad among its patrons were prohibited.
Thus the benefits of open competition were insured to all.
The policy was- among the patrons of each road uniformity,
but between the roads open competition.
X. The point is made that railways are public highways,
and the furnishing of railway transportation a governmental
function; therefore the Government should eliminate the ad-

vantage of locality by enforcing absolute uniformity in rates,
or permit the railroads to do it by preventing competition
and maintaining arbitrary. rates.
It may be conceded that the furnishing of railroad trans-
portation is a public function, and therefore the Government
may regulate it. Government, state and Federal, has done
this, by forbidding the consolidation of competing lines, by
prohibiting pooling contracts, and by making illegal all agree-
ments in restraint of trade.
The absolute uniformity demanded is neither practicable
nor desirable. Absolute uniformity, extending to every rate,
from every point, on every railroad, means absolute consoli-
dation of control and absolutely arbitrary rates, and this is
absolutely inconsistent with competition. It admits of no
competition. The desirable uniformity is that which goes
along with competition, and supplements it, and secures its
benefits to all shippers, without distinction. Each railroad
should be required to treat its patrons -persons and places
-,with fairness and equality, without preference or discrimi-
nation. It should not be required, however, to treat its ship-
pers no better than other lines treat theirs. On the contrary,
it should be induced to treat its shippers the very best it can,
and thereby make it incumbent upon competing lines to treat
their shippers as well. It should be induced to do this not
only in rates but in service. The rigid, cast-iron, arbitrary
rule of absolute uniformity as between railroads, contended
for by Mf r. Carter, would logically prevent all competition,
whether in rates or service.
If the railroads are not to be permitted to combine and pre-
vent ruinous competition, and establish and maintain reasona-
ble rates by arbitrary methods, then, it is said, they must
either abandon transport.ation, or consolidate, or persistently
violate the law.
There is a virtual consolidation of these roads now under
the agreement. The public is not interested in consolidation
except as it affects coinpetition. The constitution and laws of
many States prohibit the consolidation of railroads, but only
of competing railroads. Lines which do not compete may con-
