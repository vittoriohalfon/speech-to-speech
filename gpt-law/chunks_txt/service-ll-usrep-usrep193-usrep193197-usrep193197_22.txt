In short, it is at once an investment and a financial com-
pany.
15. Soon after its organization, and on November 18, 1901,
the Securities Co. purchased the Northern Pacific shares that
had been acquired by those concerned in the raid, known as
the Harriman shares. Those had been purchased from them
by J. P. Morgan & Co. The purchase comprised $37,023,000
of common stock and $41,085,000 of preferred stock, at a lunp
price of $91,407,500, payable (and paid) $8,915,629 in cash,
and $82,491,871 in shares of the Securities Co. at par. About,
the same time it received from its promoters and J. P. Morgan
& Co., the Northern Pacific common stock (about $42,000,000)
held by them. It availed itself of its right as a common stock-
holder of the Northern Pacific to purchase at par for cash,
the new common stock (issued to replace the $75,000,000 pre-
ferred stock retired) to the amount of 75-80 of the amount, of
common stock held by it. As a result of these purchases, the
Securities Co., at the beginning of the year 1902, and before
this suit was begun (in March, 1902) held about $152,000,000
of the total $155,000,000 stock of the Northern Pacific.
16. Soon after its organization, Mr. Hill and the other pro-
moters of the Securities Co. transferred to it about 30 millions
of Great Northern shares at $180 in exchange for Securities
shares at par, and within three months from its organization,
(and before the commencement of this suit,) the Securities
Co. had acquired, on the same terms and from other holders,
about 65 millions of Great Northern shares, making its total
holdings 95 millions of the total capital of 125 millions.
17. It is not the fact, as stated in the decision that the
Securities Co. was enabled to make the purchase of 65 millions
of stock bought from non-promoters, or of any of it, by the
advice, procurement or persuasion of the Great Northern
shareholders who had been instrumental in organizing the
Securities Co. There is not any evidence in support of this
finding, and the evidence is conclusive against it.
The facts proved beyond question are that each purchase

was an independent transaction between the seller of stock,
and the Securities Co,, without solicitation, persuasion or other
influence by the Securities Co., or any one else.
18. At the time of the formation of the Securities Co., the
Great Northern shareholders were 1,800 in number. Of them
about 1,200 transferred their shares to the Securities Co.
When this suit was begun, in April, 1902, the shareholders
of the Securities Co. were more than 1,300; in October, 1902,
they were about 1,800.
19. The Securities Co. is the absolute owner of the shares
acquired by it and of the dividends thereon. The shares are
not pooled or consolidated, nor are the earnings of the two
roads pooled. It is in no sense a "trust."
20. The promoters of the Securities Co.-Mr. Hill and his
ten associates-do not, all of them together hold, nor have they
ever held more than one-third of the $360,000,000 stock of the
Securities Co. that has been issued and is outstanding, and these
gentlemen and J. P. Morgan & Co. have never held more than
$140,000,000.
21. By the charter of each railway company, its commerce
is controlled and directed wholly by a board of directors, the
members of which are chosen for prescribed terms and cannot
be removed during their terms. And by the laws of Minne-
sota and Wisconsin no person who is a director in one com-
pany can be a director in the other.
22. The Securities Co. has not attempted to control or meddle
with the commerce or the management of either railway, nor
is there any evidence that it purposes doing either. Ever since
its formation such commerce has been conducted by the two
boards of directors in complete independence of each other.
23. There has been no agreement to suppress and no suppres-
sion of competition between the two railway companies, which
is as active as it was before the Securities Co. was formed.
24. The entire interstate commerce of the two railways,
the rates on which can be controlled by those companies with-
out other competition or consent of connecting lines, falls short

of three per cent of their total interstate commerce; and any
restraint that could be in any event impqsed by the Securities
Co. on their interstate commerce could only affect this three
per cent.
All the interstate commerce of each railroad (including the
competitive three per cent) has been largely increased since
the organization of the Securities Co., owing to the great ad-
vantages of the Burlington connection, and to the protection
afforded to all the commerce of the roads by placing a major-
ity of Northern Pacific shares beyond the reach of raids, in
the ownership. of the Securities Co. And during such period
rates have been reduced to such an extent as to reduce net
earnings by upwards of $1,000,000.
25. There has been no increase of capitalization of either
railway company, nor any watering of that of the railway com-
panies or of the Northern Securities Co. The capital of each
railway remains unchanged. If the Securities Co. had issued
its shares at par for cash, and used the money to buy the rail-
way shares for cash in the market at their market value, its
outstanding shares would be more than at present. It would
have had to issue and sell at least 190 of its shares, to be able
to buy for cash each 100 shares of Great Northern which it
has obtained by exchange of only 180 of its own shares. And
it would have had to pay more than $115 for Northern Pacific.
The course pursued, instead of watering in any way the Se-
curities Co.'s stock, has furnished that company with prop-
erties of a market and intrinsic value considerably in excess
of the par value of the shares issued by it in payment for them.
Appellants contend as to the Anti-Trust Act and its meaning:
1. The act is wholly a criminal law, directed to the punish-
ment and prevention of crime. The remedy by injunction,
etc., given by the fourth section is not to protect property in-
terests, but solely to prevent "violations of this Act" (i. e.
crimes, for every violation of the act is a crime, and, without
this section, would not be within the competence of a court of
equity to restrain by injunction).
