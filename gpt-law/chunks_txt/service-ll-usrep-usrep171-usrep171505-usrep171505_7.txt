for its interest to make lower rates than another, and without
regard to comparative skill, industry or other natural advan-
tages which furnish the true and only field for useful com-
petition. Railway transportation is a .public function, and
absolute neutrality in relation to the multitudinous competi-
tions of life is an essential condition of its just discharge.
This neutrality can be secured only by uniformity in rates.
If this is not secured by Government it must be brought about
by some private agency. It cannot be secured by governmen-
tal action, because the Government has committed. the business
to private hands. The Interstate Commerce law had this
uniformity for its prime object;. and went to the limit of Con-
gressional power in the effort to accomplish it. The prime
object of the present agreement is to supplement the effort,
not by compulsorily restricting competition, but by taking
away the motives to it. It is asked whether it is possible ta
regard an organization formed to effect an object which the
law and public policy unite in iiewing as essential, but which
Congress cannot by law reach, as a restraint upon trade? It
is believed that when this single subject is considered in all its
various relations, it is, of itself alone, decisive of the whole
controversy.
(10) The important matter of the classification of freight is
taken up and considered, and it is shown that the great end
of uniformity in rates cannot be attained without a system of
classification; that classification is only a part, although a
necessary part, of rate making; that its only object and pur-
pose is to make uniformity in rates possible; that it has never
been attempted, except as part of an effort to bring about
such uniformity, and can never be perfected, or even pre-
served, except upon the condition of such uniformity.
(11) The general usefulness of the organization formed by
the association is dwelt upon by calling attention to the mul-
titude and variety of subjects upon which it is daily engaged,
and especially to its constant occupation with the question,
how any particular rates which may happen to have been
established, or which may be proposed to be established, affect
different places and 'different merchants or mfanufacturers en-

.gaged in the same business, and who are in competition. with
each other, whether they may be a few miles or hundreds of'
miles apart. It is asserted that the association becomes the
practical arbitrator in cases where the Interstate. Commerce
law cannot operate between competing merchants and manu-
facturers, and between competing places, as to what rates
-even-handed justice to all requires; that from the nature of
the case and the interest of the railroads themselves, no rules
-can be adopted for decision of such questions except those of
justice and .equality, and that it is practically impossible that
it should be made a medium of fmonopoly, or for the exac-
tion of anything more than reasonable charges; and that
this is proved by a reference to'the course of railroad charges
during the whole period, embracing many years, in which
such agreements have existed, the fact being that they have
continually declined from the rate of about three cents a ton
or mile to less than one cent a ton or mile, a rate lower than
that. of railway transportation in any other quarter of the
world.
(12) The argument then refers to-t he matters of fact which
werd involved or assumed in the foregoing discussion, and
.justifies whatever assumptions have been made in the follow-
ing ways: (a). That, by the very nature of the case, they are
matters which must necessarily be true, because they are the
-results of the operation of the familiar and well-known laws
-relating to industrial pursuits. (b) Because they have that
notoriety which requires a court to take judicial notice of
them. (e) Because -they are fully established by averments
in the answer admitted by the appellant in setting down the
-cause for hearing upon bill and answer. (d) By the declara-
tions, repeated in multiplied forms, of the Interstate Commerce
'Commission, the great public agency which has such super-
vision and control over the business of railway transportation
:as Congress can assert. Copious extracts from these declara-
tions are set forth.
(13) These extracts and other proofs thus referred to are
:again declared to stamp this association as one instance, of
which industrial life furnishes "a multitude, where industrial

interests of great magnitude are subjected to private regula-
tion, and for the reason that the State recognizes, and always
has recognized, the fact that such regulation is far more effec-
tive over a large range of subjects than any which the State
itself could devise and enforce. This statement is confirmed
and illustrated by reference to many different instances. (a) To
the multitudinous associations among workmen and employ~s"
of various descriptions, All based upon agreements far more
in restraint of competition than any contained in this in-
strument. (b) Similar unions among the employers of labor.
(o) To the numerous Commercial, 'Stock and Produce Ex-
changes and Boards of Trade, all of which prescribe rates of
commission and for compensation for various services, and
forbid any departure from them, and are far more restrictive
of competition than any provision in the agreement in ques-
tion.
(14) The question is submitted whether trade is in any way
restrained by the agreements between laborers and employ~s,
or those between the employers of labor, and it is answered
by saying that the final and general results, notwithstanding
occasional abuses, are greatly to increase the efficiency of
labor and the amount of work done, and -to elevate the char-
acter of the laboring classes. The same question is asked
in respect to Commercial Exchanges and Boards of Trade,
whether they restrain the. business wi*th which they are con-
ducted, whether there is. less buying or selling of goods in
consequence of commissions or other charges being fixed at
particular sums. It is answered by saying that, as every one
knows, these are all agencies by which the number and mag-
nitude of business transactions is enormously increased.
The same question is put in relation to the operation of the
present agreement, or of any agreement tending to secure
uniformity in railroad rates and the stability, certainty and
safety of railway transportation; and it is asked whether,
in consequence of such agreements, the business of railway
transportation or the exchange of commodities is in any par-
ticular diminished, and whether it is not, on the contrary,.
prodigiously extended and enlarged.
