Opinion of the Court.
like that the remedy would probably be forthcoming. Tans-
portation Co. v. Parkersburg,1 07 U. S. 691. As was said by
Mr. Justice Field, in Sands v. Manistee Rives Improvement
Co., 123 U. S. 288, 294, 295, "should there be any gross in-
justice in the rate of tolls fixed, it would not in our system of
government, remain long uncorrected."
But whether the charges are or are not exorbitant is a ques-
tion primarily of local law, at least in the absence of any
superior or paramount law providing for reasonable charges.
Transportation Co. v. Parkersburg,1 07 U. S. 691. This case
does not involve that question.
If charges of the nature described do not amount to a regu-
iation of interstate trade or commerce because they touch it
only in an indirect and remote way, or" else because they are
in the nature of compensation for the use of property or privi-
leges as a mere facility for that commerce, it would for a-like
reason seem clear that agreements relating to the amounts of
such charges among those who furnish the privileges or facili-
ties are not in restraint of that kind of trade. While the indi-
rect effect 'of the agreements may be to enhance the expense
to those engaged in the business, yet as the agreements are in
regard to compensatign for privileges accorded for services
rendered as a facility to commerce or trade, they are not il-
legal as a restraint thereon.
The facilities or privileges offdred by the defendants are
apparent and valuable. The cattle owner has the use of a.
place for his cattle furnished by the defendants and all the
facilities arising from a market where the -sales and purchases
are conducted under the auspices of the association of which
the defendants are members, and in a manner the least trouble-
some to the owners and at the same time the most expeditious
and effective. Each of these defenidants has the right to have
the cattle which are consigned to him taken to the cattle yards,
where, by virtue- of the arrangements made by defendants
with the owners of the yards, the cattle are placed in pens,
watered and fed, if necessary, and a sale effected at the earliest
moment. It is these facilities and services which are paid for
by a commission on the sale effected by the commission men.

HOPKINS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.
If, as is claimed, the commission men sometimes own the
cattle they sell, then the rules do not apply, for they relate
to charges made for selling cattle upon commission and not
at all to sales of cattle by their bwners.
Definitions as to what constitutes interstate commerce are
not easily given so that they shall clearly define the full
meaning of the term. We know from the cases decided in
this court that it is a term of very large significance. It com-
prehends, as it is said, intercourse for the purposes of trade in
any and all its forms, including transportation, purchase, sale
and exchange of commodities between the citizens of different
States, and the power to regulate it embraces all the instru-
ments by which such commerce may be conducted. Welton
v. Missouri, 91 "U. S. 275; Mob*ile County v. Kimball, 102
U. S. 691; Gloucester Ferry Company v. Pennsylvania, 114
U. S. 196; ifooper v. California,1 55 U. S. 648, 653; United
States v. E. C.. Knight Company, 156 U. S. 1.
But in all the cases which have come to this court there is
not one which has. denied the distinction between a regulation
which directly affects and embarrasses interstate trade or
commerce, and one which is nothing more than a charge
for a local facility provided for the transaction of such
commerce. On the contrary, the cases already cited show
the existence of the distinction and the validity of a charge
for the use of the facility.
The services of members of the different stock and produce
exchanges througlout the coulitry in effecting sales of the
articles they deal in are of a similar nature. ,Members of the
New York Stock Exchange buy and sell shares of stock of
railroads and other corporations, and the property represented
by such shares of stock is situated all over the country. Is a
broker whose principal lives outside of New York State, and
who sends him the shares of stock or the bonds of a corpora-
tion created and doing business in another State, for sale.
engaged in interstate commerce? If he is employed to pur-
chase stock or bonds in a like corporation under the same
circumstances, is he then engaged in the business of interstate
commerce? It may, perhaps, be answered that stocks or

bonds are not commodities, and that dealers therein are not
engaged in commerce. Whether it is an answer to the ques-
tion need not be considered, for we will take the case of the
New York Produce Exchange. Is a member of that body to
whom a cargo of grain is consigned from a western State to
be sold engaged in interstate commerce when he performs the
service of selling the article upon its arrival in New York and
transmitting the proceeds of the sale less his commissions? Is
a New Orleans cotton broker who is a member of the Cotton
Exchange of that city, and who receives consignments of cot-
ton from different States and sells them on 'change in New
Orleans and accounts to his consignors for the proceeds of
such sales less his commission, engaged in interstate commerce?
Is the character of the business altered in either case by the
fact that the broker has advanced moneys to the owner of the
article and taken a mortgage thereon as his security?. We
understand we are in these queries assuming substantially the
same facts as those which are contained in the case before us,
and if these defendants are engaged in interstate commerce
because of their services in the sale of. cattle which may come
from other States, then the same must be said in regard
to the members of the other exchanges above referred to.
We think it, would be an entirely novel view of the situation
if all the members of- these different exchaiiges throughout
the country were to be regarded as engaged in interstate.
commerce, because they sell things for their principals which
come from States different from the one in which the ex-
change is situated and the sale made.
The theory upon which we think the by-law or agreement
regarding commissions is. not a violation of the statute
operates also in the case of the other provisions of the by-
laws. The answer in regard to all objections is, the defend-
ants are not engaged in interstate commerce.
But special weight is attached to the objection raised to
section 11 of rule 9 of the by-laws, which provides against
sehding prepaid telegrams as set forth in the statement of
facts herein. It is urged' that the purpose of this section is
to prevent the sending of prepaid telegrams by the defendants
