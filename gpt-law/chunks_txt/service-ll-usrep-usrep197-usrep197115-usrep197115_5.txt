NATIONAJ JVT TON OIL CO. v. TEXAS.
197 U. S. Opinion of the Court.
The first question has been answered by the Supreme Court
of Texas in State v. Laredo Ice Co., 96 Texas, 461, in the affirm-
ative, and nothing can be added to the strength of the opinion
in that case, and this court will follow the interpretation placed
upon a statute of a State by its highest court.
As to the second question, the identical proposition has been
decided in Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, 177 U. S. 28; Waters-
Pierce Oil Co. v. State, 19 Civ. App. 1; State v. Shippers' Com-
press and Warehouse Co., 95 Texas, 603.
MR. JUSTICE McKENNA, after stating the case as above,
delivered the opinion of the court.
The charges made against the statutes of Texas are that
they deny the oil company the equal protection of the law and
take its property without due process of law. The answer to
the first depends upon the effect of the statutes. The answer
to the second involves their validity and broader considera-
tions. We will deal with it first.
The specification in the demurrer of wherein the statutes
deprive the oil company of its property without due process of
law is indefinite and peculiar. It may be different from an
attack on the validity of the statutes, but counsel have treated
it as tantamount to such attack, and we will so treat it.
Defendant in error contends that it is not open to the oil
company to attack the constitutionality of the statutes, either
as discriminating against it or as depriving it of property with-
out due process of law, 'and cites Waters-Pierce Oil Company
v. Texas, 177 U. S. 28. Counsel for the company contests the
application of that case; and we will assume (not decide) with
them that it is not determinative of their contention.
The acts of 1889 and 1895 are set out at length in the Waters-
PierceO il Company case. The act of 1899, so far as the present
question is concerned, is substantially the same as those acts.
All of the acts are directed to the prohibition of combinations
to restrict trade, or in any way limit competition in the pro-

duction or sale of articles, or to increase or reduce their price
in order to preclude a free and unrestricted competition in
them. The various ways in which these purposes can be ac-
complished are enumerated and forbidden. Penalties are
affixed to the violation of the acts, offending domestic corpo-
rations forfeit their charters, and offending foreign corpora-
tions forfeit their privileges to do business in the State.
There was also an act passed in 1903, which repealed all laws
or parts of laws in conflict with it, and expressly repealed cer-
tain provisions of the Penal Code of the State, and the acts of
1895 and 1899. The right to recover penalties or to forfeit
charters of domestic, or the permits of foreign, corporations,
for acts committed before the going into effect of the statutes,
was reserved.
The argument, which is directed against the validity of the
statutes, is drawn from extremes. It is difficult to present its
elements in a concise way. Its ultimate foundation is the
right of individuals and corporations as well, under the Con-
stitution of the United States, to make contracts and combine
in business enterprises; and, it is argued, to prohibit them from
so doing" in the ordinary way through the making of purchases
and sales and the fixing of prices, is clearly to work a depriva-
tion of property without due process of law and to impair the
well recognized liberty of contract, involved in the acquiring,
using and dealing with property," assured by the Federal
Constitution.
To support the argument the usages and necessity of business
are adduced, and partnerships and their effect are brought
forward as illustrations. There are some things which counsel
easily demonstrate. They easily demonstrate that some com-
bination of "capital, skill or acts " is necessary to any business
development, and that the result must inevitably be a cessa-
tion of competition. But this does not prove that all combina-
tions are inviolable or that no restriction upon competition
can be forbidden. To contend for these extremes is to over-
look the difference in the effect of actions, and to limit too

much the function and power of government. By arguing
from extremes almost every exercise of government can be
shown to be a deprivation of individual liberty. It is common-
place to say that it is the purpose, and indeed duty, of govern-
ment, to get all it can of good out of the activities of men, and
limit or forbid them when they become or tend to evil. Of
course, what is evil may not be always clear; but to be able
to dispute the policy of a law is not to establish its invalidity.
It is certainly the conception of a large body of public opinion
that the control of prices through combinations tends to re-
straint of trade and to monopoly, and is evil. The founda-
tions of the belief we are not called upon to discuss, nor does
our purpose require us to distinguish between the kinds of
combinations or the degrees of monopoly. It is enough to
say that the idea of monopoly is not now confined to a grant of
privileges. It is understood to include a "condition produced
by the acts of mere individuals." Its dominant thought now
is, to quote another, "the notion of exclusiveness or unity;"
in other words, the suppression of competition by the unifica-
tion of interest or management, or it may be through agree-
ment and concert of action. And the purpose is so definitely
the control of prices that monopoly has been defined to be
"unified tactics with regard to prices." It is the power to
control prices which makes the inducement of combinations
and their profit. It is such power that makes it the concern
of the law to prohibit or limit them. And this concern and
the policy based upon it has not only expression in the Texas
statutes; it has expression in the statutes of other States and
in a well known national enactment. According to them,
competition not combination, should be the law of trade. If
there is evil in this it is accepted as less than that which may
result from the unification of interest, and the power such
unification gives. And that legislatures may so ordain this
court has decided. United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156
