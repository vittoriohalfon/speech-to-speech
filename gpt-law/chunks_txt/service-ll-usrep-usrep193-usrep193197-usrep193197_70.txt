these respectively are. Contracts in restraint of trade are
dealt with and defined by the common law. They are con-
tracts with a stranger to the contractor's business, (although
in some cases carrying on a similar one,) which wholly or par-
tially restrict the freedom of the contractor in carrying on
that business as otherwise he would. The objection of the
common law to them was primarily on the contractor's own
account. The notion of monopoly did not come in unless the
contract covered the whole of England. Ml'itchel v. Rcynolds,
1 P. Wms. 181. Of course this objection did not apply to
partnerships or other forms, if there were any, of substituting
a community of interest where there had been competition.
There was no objection to such combinations merely as in re-
straint of trade, or otherwise unless they amounted to a
monopoly. Contracts in restraint of trade, I repeat, were
contracts with strangers to the contractor's business, and the
trade restrained was the contractor's own.
Combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, on the
other hand, were combinations to keep strangers to the agree-
ment out of the business. The objection to them was not an
objection to their effect upon the parties makig the contract,
the members of the combination or firm, but an objection to
their intended effect upon strangers to the firm and their sup-
posed consequent effect upon the public at large. In other
words, they were regarded as contrary to public policy because
they monopolized or attempted to monopolize sonic portion of
the trade or commerce of the realm. See United States v. E. C.
Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1. All that is added to the first section by
§ 2 is that like penalties are imposed upon every single person
who, without combination, monopolizes or attempts to monopo-
lize commerce among the States; and that the liability is ex-
tended to attempting to monopolize any part of such trade or
commerce. It is more important as an aid to the construction
of § 1 than it is on its own account. It shows that whatever is
criminal when done by way of combination is equally criminal
if done by a single man. That I am right in my interpretation

of the words of § I is shown by the words "in the form of trust
or otherwise." The prohibition was suggested by the trusts,
the objection to which, as every one knows, was not the union
of former competitors, but the sinister power exercised or sup-
posed to be exercised by the combination in keeping rivals out
of the business and ruining those who already were in. It
was the ferocious extreme of competition with others, not the
cessation of competition among the partners, that was the evil
feared. Further proof is to be found in § 7, giving an action
to any person injured in his business or property by the for-
bidden conduct. This cannot refer to the parties to the agree-
ment and plainly means that outsiders who are injured in their
attempt 'to compete with a trust or other similar combination
may recover for it. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, 193 U. S.
38. How effective the section may be or how far it goes, is
not material to my point. My general summary of the two
classes of cases which the act affects is confirmed by the title,
which is "An Act to protect Trade and Commerce against
unlawful Restraints and Monopolies."
What I now ask is under which of the foregoing classes this
case is supposed to come, and that question must be answered
as definitely and precisely as if we were dealing with the in-
dictments which logically ought to follow this decision. The
provision of the statute against contracts in restraint of
trade has been held to apply to contracts between railroads,
otherwise remaining independent, by which they restricted
their respective freedom as to rates. This restriction by con-
tract with a stranger to the contractor's business is the ground
of the decision in United States v. Joint Traffic Association,
171 U. S. 505, following and affirming United States v. Trans-
Missouri Freight Association, 166 U. S. 290. I accept those
decisions absolutely, not only as binding upon me, but as de-
cisions which I have no desire to criticise or abridge. But
the provision has not been decided, and, it seems to me, could
not be decided without perversion of plain language, to apply
to an arrangement by which competition is ended through com-

munity of interest-an arrangement which leaves the parties
without external restriction. That provision, taken alone,
does not require that all existing competitions shall be main-
tained. It does not look primarily, if at all, to competition.
It simply requires that a party's freedom in trade between the
States shall not be cut down by contract with a stranger. So
far as that phrase goes, it is lawful to abolish competition by
any form of union. It would seem to me impossible to say
that the words "every contract in restraint of trade is a crime
punishable with imprisonment," would send the members of a
partnership between, or a consolidation of, two trading cor-
porations to prison-still more impossible to say that it forbade
one man or corporation to purchase as much stock as he liked
in both. Yet those words would have that effect if this clause
of § 1 applies to the defendants here. For it cannot be too
carefully remembered that that clause applies to "every"
contract of the forbidden kind-a consideration which was the
turning point of the Trans-Missouri Freight Association's
case.
If the statute applies to this case it must be because the
parties, or some of them, have formed, or because the Northern
Securities Company is, a combination in restraint of trade
among the States, or, what comes to the same thing in my
opinion, because the defendants, or some or one of them, are
monopolizing or attempting to monopolize some part of the
commerce between the States. But the mere reading of those
words shows that they are used in a limited and accurate
sense. According to popular speech, every concern nonopo-
lizes whatever business it does, and if that business is trade
between two States it monopolizes a part of the trade among
the States. Of course the statute does not forbid that. It
does not mean that all business must cease. A single railroad
down a narrow valley or through a mountain gorge monopo-
lizes all the railroad transportation through that valley or
gorge. Indeed every railroad monopolizes, in a popular sense,
the trade of some area. Yet I suppose no one would say that
