NORTHERN SECURITIES COMPANY v. UNITED
STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.
No. 277. Argued December 14, 15, 1903.-Decided March 14, 1904.
Stockholders of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway com-
panies-corporations having competing and substantially parallel lines
from the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean at
Puget Sound-combined and conceived the scheme of organizing a cor-
poration, under the laws of New Jersey, which should hold the shares
of the stock of the constituent companies, such shareholders, in lieu of
their shares in those companies, to receive, upon an agreed basis of value,
shares in the holding corporation. Pursuant to such combination the
Northern Securities Company was organized as the holding corporation
through which that scheme should be executed; and under that scheme
such holding corporation became the holder-more properly speaking,
tile custodian-of more than nine-tenths of the stock of the Northern
Pacific, and more than three-fourths of the stock of the Great Northern,
the stockholders of the companies, who delivered their stock, receiving,
upon the agreed basis, shares of stock in the holding corporation.
Held, that, necessarily, the constituent companies ceased, under this arrange-
ment, to be in active competition for trade and commerce along their
respective lines, and became, practically, one powerful consolidated cor-
poration, by the name of a holding corporation, the principal, if not the
sole, object for the formation of which was to carry out the purpose of
the original combination under which competition between the constitu-
ent companies would cease.
Held, that the arrangement was an illegal combination in restraint of in-
terstate commerce and fell within the prohibitions and provisions of the
act of July 2, 1890, and it was within the power of the Circuit Court, in
an action, brought by the Attorney General of the United States after the
completion of the transfer of such stock to it, to enjoin the holding com-
pany, from voting such stock and from exercising any control whatever
over the acts and doings of the railroad companies, and also to enjoin the
railroad companies from paying any dividends to the holding corpora-
tipn on any of their stock held by it.
Held, that although cases should not be brought within a statute containing
criminal provisions that are not clearly embraced by it, the court should
not by narrow, technical or forced construction of words exclude cases
from it that are obviously within its provisions and while the act of
July 2, 1890, contains criminal provisions, the Federal court has power
under ยง 4 of the act in a suit in equity to prevent and restrain violations

of the act, and may mould its decree so as to accomplish practical results
such as law and justice demand.
HARLAN, BnowN, McKENNA and DAY, JJ.
The combination is, within the meaning of the act of Congress of July 2,
1890, known as the Anti-Trust Act, a "trust"; but if not, it is a combina-
tion in restraint of interstate and international commerce, and that is
enough to bring it under the condemnation of the act.
From prior cases in this court, the following propositions are deducible and
embrace this case:
Although the act of Congress known as the Anti-Trust Act has no reference
to the mere manufacture or production of articles or commodities within
the limits of the several States, it embraces and declares to be illegal
every contract, combination or conspiracy, in whatever form, of what-
ever nature, and whoever may be parties to it, which directly or neces-
sarily operates in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States
or with foreign nations.
The act is not limited to restraints of interstate and international trade or
commerce that are unreasonable in their nature, but embraces all direct
restraints, reasonable or unreasonable, imposed by any combination, con-
spiracy or monopoly upon such trade or commerce.
Railroad carriers engaged in interstate or international trade or commerce
are embraced by the act.
Combinations, even among private manufacturers or dealers, whereby
interstate or international commerce is restrained, are equally embraced
by the act.
Congress has the power to establish rules by which interstate and inter-
national commerce shall be governed, and by the Anti-Trust Act has
prescribed the rule of free competition among those engaged in such
commerce.
Every combination or conspiracy which would extinguish competition
between otherwise competing railroads, engaged in interstate trade or
commerce, and which would in that way restrain such trade or com-
merce, is made illegal by the act.
The natural effect of competition is to increase commerce, and an agreement
whose direct effect is to prevent this play of competition restrains in-
stead of promotes trade and commerce.
To vitiate a combination, such as the act of Congress condemns, it need not
Mr. Justice HARLAN announced the affirmance of the decree of the Circuit
Court and delivered an opinion in which Bnow;, MCKENNA and DAY, JJ.,
concurred. Mr. Justice BREwEp delivered a separate opinion in which he
concurred in affirming the decree of the Circuit Court.
Mr. Justice WHITE delivered a dissenting opinion in which the CHIEF
JUSTICE and PECKHA.M and HOLMES, JJ., concurred; Mr. Justice llOL.NES
delivered a dissenting opinion in which the CHIEF JUSTICE and WHITE and
PEcKHAMu, JJ., concurred.

be shown that such combination, in fact, results, or will result, in a total
suppression of trade or in a complete monopoly, but it is only essential
to show that by its necessary operation it tends to restrain interstate or
international trade or commerce, or tends to create a monopoly in such
trade or commerce, and to deprive the public of the advantages that flow
from free competition.
The constitutional guarantee of liberty of contract does not prevent Con-
gress from prescribing the rule of free competition for those engaged in
interstate and international commerce.
Under its power to regulate commerce among the several States and with
foreign nations, Congress had authority to enact the statute in question.
United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1; United States v, Trans-
1fissouri Freight Association, 166 U. S. 290; United States v. Joint Traffic
Association, 171 U. S. 505; Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578; An-
derson v. United States, 171 U.S. 604; Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. Uni-
ted States, 175 U. S. 211; Montague & Co. v. Lowr/, 193 U. S. 38.
Congress may protect the freedom of interstate commerce by any means
that are appropriate and that are lawful and not prohibited by the Con-
stitution.
If in the judgment of Congress the public convenience or the general welfare
will be best subserved when the natural laws of competition are left un-
disturbed by those engaged in interstate commerce, that must be, for all,
the end of the matter, if this is to remain a government of laws, and not
of men.
When Congress declared contracts, combinations and conspiracies in re-
straint of trade or commerce to be illegal, it did nothing more than apply
to interstate commerce a rule that had been long applied by the several
States when dealing with combinations that were in restraint of their
domestic commerce.
Subject to such restrictions as are imposed by the Constitution upon the
exercise of all power, the power of Congress over interstate and inter-
national commerce is as full and complete as is the power of any State
over its domestic commerce.
No State can, by merely creating a corporation, or in any other mode,
project its authority into other States, so as to prevent Congress from
exerting the power it possesses under the Constitution over interstate
and international commerce, or so as to exempt its corporation engaged
in interstate commerce from obedience to any rule lawfully established
by Congress for such commerce; nor can any State give a corporation
created under its laws authority to restrain interstate or international
commerce against the will of the nation as lawfully expressed by Con-
gress. Every corporation created by a State is necessarily subject to the
supreme law of the land.
Whilst every instrumentality of domestic commerce is subject to state
control, every instrumentality of interstate commerce may be reached
and controlled by national authority, so far as to compel it to respect
the rules for such commerce lawfully established by Congress.
