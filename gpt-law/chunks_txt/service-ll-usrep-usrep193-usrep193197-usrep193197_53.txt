nations. In Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 446, it was
said: "Those who felt the injury arising from this state of
things, and those who were capable of estimating the influence
of commerce on the prosperity of nations, perceived the ne-
cessity of giving the control over this important subject to a
single government. It may be doubted whether any of the
evils proceeding from the feebleness of the Federal Government
contributed more to that great revolution which introduced
the present system than the deep and general conviction that
commerce ought to be regulated by Congress." Railroad
companies, we said in the Trans-Missouri Freight Association
case, "are instruments of commerce, and their business is
commerce itself." And such companies, it must be remem-
bered, operate "public highways, established primarily for the
convenience of the people, and therefore are subject to gov-
ernmental control and regulation." Cherokee Nation v. Kansas
Railway Co., 135 U. S. 641, 657; Chicago &c. R. R. Co. v.
Pullman Car Co., 139 U. S. 79, 90; Interstate Commerce Com-
mission v. Brimson, 154 U. S. 447, 475; United States v. Trans-
Missouri Freight Association, 166 U. S. 290, 332"; Smyth v.
Ames, 169 U. S. 466, 544; Lake Shore &c. Ry. Co. v. Ohio, 173
U. S. 285, 301. When such carriers, in the exercise of public
franchises, engage in the transportation of passengers and
freight among the States they become-even if they be state
corporations-subject to such rules as Congress may lawfully
establish for the conduct of interstate commerce.
It was said in argument that the circumstances under which
the Northern Securities Company obtained the stock of the
constituent companies imported simply an investment in the
stock of other corporations, a purchase of that stock; which
investment or purchase, it is contended, was not forbidden
by the charter of the company and could not be made illegal
by any act of Congress. This view is wholly fallacious, and
does not comport with the actual transaction. There was no
actual investment, in any substantial sense, by the Northern
Securities Company in the stock of the two constituent com-

panies. If it was, in form, such a transaction, it was not, in
fact, one of that kind. However that company may have
acquired for itself any stock in the Great Northern and North-
ern Pacific Railway companies, no matter how it obtained the
means to do so, all the stock it held or acquired in the con-
stituent companies was acquired and held to be used in sup-
pressing competition between those companies. It came into
existence only for that purpose. If any one had full knowl-
edge of what was designed to be accomplished, and as to what
was actually accomplished, by the combination in question,
it was the defendant Morgan. In his testimony he was asked,
"Why put the stocks of both these [constituent companies]
into one holding company?" He frankly answered: "In the
first place, this holding company was simply a. question of
custodian, because it had no other alliances." That disclosed
the actual nature of the transaction, which was only to organize
the Northern Securities Company as a holding company, in
whose hands, not as a real purchaser or absolute owner, but
simply as custodian, were to be placed the stocks of the con-
stituent companies-such custodian to represent the com-
bination formed between the shareholders of the constituent
companies, the direct and necessary effect of such combination
being, as already indicated, to restrain and monopolize inter-
state commerce by suppressing or (to use the words of this
court in United States v. Joint Traffic Association) "smothering"
competition between the lines of two railway carriers.
We will now inquire as to the nature and extent of the relief
granted to the Government by the decree below.
By the decree in the Circuit Court it was found and adjudged
that the defendants had entered into a combination or con-
spiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several
States, such as the act of Congress denounced as illegal; and
that all of the stocks of the Northern Pacific Railway Company
and all the stock of the Great Northern Railway Company,
claimed to be owned and held by the Northern Securities Com-
pany, was acquired, and is by it held, in virtue of such com-

bination or conspiracy, in restraint of trade and commerce
among the several States. It was therefore decreed as follows:
"That the Northern Securities Company, its officers, agents,
servants and employ6s, be and they are hereby enjoined from
acquiring, or attempting to acquire, further stock of either of
the aforesaid railway companies; that the Northern Securities
Company be enjoined from voting the aforesaid stock which
it now holds or may acquire, and from attempting to vote it,
at any meeting of the stockholders of either of the aforesaid
railway companies and from exercising or attempting to exer-
cise any control, direction, supervision or influence whatsoever
over the acts and doings of said railway companies, or either
of them, by virtue of its holding such stock therein; that the
Northern Pacific Railway Company and the Great Northern
Railway Company, their officers, directors, servants and agents,
be and they are hereby respectively and collectively enjoined
from permitting the stock aforesaid to be voted by the North-
ern Securities Company, or in its behalf, by its attorneys or
agents, at any corporate election for directors or officers of
either of the aforesaid railway companies; that they, together
with their officers, directors, servants and agents, be likewise
enjoined and respectively restrained from paying any dividends
to the Northern Securities Company on account of stock in
either of the aforesaid railway companies which it now claims
to own and hold; and that the aforesaid railway companies,
their officers, directors, servants and agents, be enjoined from
permitting or suffering the Northern Securities Company or
any of its officers or agents, as such officers or agents, to exer-
cise any control whatsoever over the corporate acts of either
of the aforesaid railway companies. But nothing herein con-
tained shall be construed as prohibiting the Northern Securi-
ties Company from returning and transferring to the 'Northern
Pacific Railway Company and the Great Northern Railway
Company, respectively, any and all shares of stock in either
of said railway companies which said, The Northern Securities-
Company, may have heretofore received from such stock-
