Opinion of the Court.
sel for the defendants refer in considerable detail to its history
from the time of its introduction in the Senate to its final
passage. As the act originally passed the Senate the first
section was in substance as it stands at present in the statute.
On its receipt by the House that body proposed an amend-
ment, by which it was in terms made unlawful to eiter into
any contract for the purpose of preventing competition in the,
transportation of persons or property. As thus amended the
bill went back to the Senate, which itself amended the amend-
ment by making the act apply to any such contract as tended
to raise prices for transportation above what was just and
reasonable. This amendment by the Senate of the amend-
ment proposed by the House was disagreed to by that body.
The amendments were then considered by conference com-
mittees, and the first conference committee reported to each
house in favor of the amendment of the Senate. This report
was disagreed to and another committee appointed, which
agreed to strike out both amendments and leave the bill as
it stood when it first passed the Senate, and that report was
finally adopted, and the bill thus passed.
Looking at the debates during the various times when the
bill was before the Senate and the House, both on its original
passage by the Senate and upon the report from the conference
committees, it is seen that various views were declared in re-
gard to the legal import of the act. Some of the members of
the House wanted it placed beyond doubt or cavil that con-
tracts in relation to the transportation of persons and property
were included in the bill. Some thought the amendment un-
necessary as the language of the act already covered it, and
some refused to vote for the amendment or for the bill if the
amendments were adopted on the ground that it would then
interfere with the Interstate Commerce Act, and tend to create
confusion as to the meaning of each act. Senator Hoar (who
was a member of the first committee of conference from the
Senate), when reporting the result arrived at by the judiciary
committee recommending the adoption of the House amend-
ment, said: "The other clause, of the House amendment is
that contracts or agreements entered into for the purpose of

preventing competition in the transportation of persons or prop-
erty from one State or Territory into another shall be deemed
unlawful. That, the committee recommend shall be concurred
in. We suppose that it is already covered by the bill as it
stands; that is, that transportation is as much trade or com-
merce among the several States as the sale of goods in one
State to be delivered in another, and, therefore, that it is
covered already by the bill as it stands. But there is no
harm in agreeing in an amendment which expressly describes
it, and an objection to the amendment might be construed as
if the Senate did not mean to include it; so we let it stand."
Looking simply at the history of the bill from the time it
was introduced in the Senate until it was finally passed, it
would be impossible to say what were the views of a majority
of the members of each house in relation to the meaning of
the act. It cannot be said that a majority of both houses did
not agree with Senator Hoar in his views as to the construction
to be given to the act as it passed the Senate. All that can
be determined from the debates and reports is that various
members had various views, and we are left to determine the
meaning of this act, as we determine the meaning of other
acts, from the language used therein.
There is, too, a general acquiescence in the doctrine that
debates in Congress are not appropriate sources of informa-
tion from which to discover the meaning of the language of a
statute passed by that body. United States v. Union Pacific
Railroad Company, 91 U. S. 72, 79; Aldridge v. Williams,
3 How. 9, 24, Taney, Chief Justice; Mitchell v. Gread Works
Milling & Manufacturing Company, 2 Story, 648, 653 ; Queen
v. tertfbrd College, 3 Q. B. D. 693, 707.
The reason is that it is impossible to determine with cer-
tainty what construction was put upon an act by the nmem-
bers of a legislative body that passed it by resorting to the
speeches of individual members thereof. Those who did not
speak may not have agreed with those who did; and those
who spoke might differ from each other; the result being
that the only proper way to construe a legislative act is from
the language used in the act, and, upon occasion, by a resort

to the history of the times when it was passed. (Cases cited,
sUpra.) If such resort be had, we are still unable to see
that the railroads were not intended to be included in this
legislation.
It is said that Congress had very different matters in view
and very different objects to accomplish in the passage of the
act in question; that a number of combinations'in the form of
trusts and conspiracies in restraint of trade were to be found
throughout the country, and that it was impossible for the
state governments to successfully cope with them because of
their commercial character and of their business extension
through the d iferent States of the Union. Among these
trusts it was said in Congress were the Beef Trust, the Stand-
ard Oil Trust, the Steel Trust, the Barbed Fence Wire Trust,
the Sugar. Trust, the Cordage Trust, the Cotton Seed Oil
Trust, the Whiskey Trust and many others, and these trusts it
was stated had assumed an importance and had acquired a
power which were dangerous to the whole country, and that
their existence was directly antagonistic to its peace and pros-
perity. To combinations and conspiracies of this kind it is
contended that the act in question was directed, and not to
the combinations of competing railroads to keep up their prices
to a reasonable sum for the transportation of persons and
property. It is true that many and various trusts were in
existence at the time of the passage of the act, and it was
probably sought to cover them by the provisions of the act.
Many of them had rendered themselves offensive by the
manner in which they exercised the great power that com-
bined capital gave them. But a further investigation of "the
history of the times" shows also that those trusts were not
the only associations controlling a great combination of capi-
tal which bad caused complaint at the manner in which their
business was conducted. There were many and loud com-
plaints from some portions of the public regarding the rail-
roads and the prices they were charging for the service they
rendered, and it was alleged that the prices for the transpor-
tation of persons and articles of commerce were unduly and
improperly enhanced by combinations among the different
