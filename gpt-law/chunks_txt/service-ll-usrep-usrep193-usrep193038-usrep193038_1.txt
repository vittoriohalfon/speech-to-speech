the provisions of particular state laws were so unequal in their
operation upon the rights of parties as to engender the inequal-
ity prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. None of the
cases, therefore, lends support to the proposition upon which
this case depends; that is, that although there has been no de-
nial of the equal protection of the laws, nevertheless such de-
nial must be held to exist only because the State has seen fit
to direct under particular conditions a trial of a cause in one
forum instead of in another, when in both forums equal laws
are applicable and an equal administration of justice obtained.

MONTAGUE & COMPANY v. LOWRY.
ERROR TO THE OIROUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIROUIT.
No. 46. Submitted October 27, 1903.-Decided February 23, 1904.
An association was formed in California by manufacturers of, and dealers
in, tiles, mantels and grates; the dealers agreed not to purchase materials
from manufacturers who were not members and not to sell unset tiles to
any one other than members for less than list prices which were fifty
per cent higher than the prices to members; the manufacturers, who
were residents of States other than California agreed not to sell to any
one other than members; violations of the agreement rendered the mem)-
ber subject to forfeiture of membership. Membership in the association
was prescribed by rules and dependent on conditions, one of which was
the carrying of at least $3,000 worth of stock, and whether applicants were
admitted was a matter for the arbitrary decision of the association.
In an action by a firm of dealers in tiles, mantels and grates, in San
Francisco, whose members had never been asked to join the association
and who had never applied for admission therein, and which did not
always carry $3,000 worth of stock, to recover damages under ยง 7 of
the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890-
Held that although the sales of unset tiles were within the State of California
and although such sales constituted a very small portion of the trade
involved, agreement of manufacturers without the State not to sell to
any one but members was part of a scheme which included the enhance-
ment of the price of unset tiles by the dealers within the State and that the
whole thing was so bound together that the transactions within the State
were inseparable and became a part of a purpose which when carried out
amounted to, and was, a combination in restraint of interstate trade and

commerce. Addystor Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U. S. 211,
followed; Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578; Anderson v. United
States, 171 U. S. 604, distinguished.
Held that the association constituted and amounted to an agreement
or combination in restraint of trade within the meaning of the act of
July 2, 1890, and that the parties aggrieved were entitled to recover
threefold the damages found by the jury.
Held that the amount of attorney's fees allowed as costs under the act is
within the discretion of the trial court and as such discretion is reason-
ably exercised this court will not disturb the amount awarded.
THis action was brought under section I of the act of July 2,
1890, 26 Stat. 209 ; 3 Comp. Stat. 3202, commonly called the
Anti-Trust Act. The section reads as follows:
"SEc. 1. Any person who shall be injured in his business or
property by any other person or corporation by reason of any-
thing forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act, may
sue therefor in any Circuit Court of the United States in the
district in which the defendant resides or is found, without
respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover three-
fold the damages by him sustained, and the costs of suit, in-
cluding a reasonable attorney's fee."
Plaintiffs in error (defendants below) seek to review the
judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-
cuit, 115 Fed. IRep. 27, affirming a judgment for plaintiffs,
entered in the Circuit Court for the Northern District of Cali-
fornia, upon a verdict of a jury. 106 Fed. Rep. 38.
It appeared in evidence on the trial in the United States
Circuit Court that the plaintiffs for many years prior to the
commencement of this action had been copartners, doing busi-
ness as such in the city of San Francisco in the State of Cali-
fornia, and dealing in tiles, mantels and grates, and that The
Tile, Mantel and Grate Association of California, and the of-
ficers and members thereof, had since, on or about the-day
of January, 1898, constituted under that name an unincor-
porated organization composed of wholesale dealers in tiles,
mantels and grates, who were citizens and residents of the city
and county of San Francisco, or the city of Sacramento, or the
city of San Jos6 in the State of California, and such organiza-
tion was also composed of the manufacturers of tiles, mantels

and grates, who were residents of other States, and engaged
in the sale of their manufactured articles (among others) to
the various other defendants in the State of California. There
were no manufacturers of tiles within the State of California,
and all the defendants who were residents of that State and
who were also dealers in tiles, in the prosecution of their 1)usi-
ness, procured the tiles from outside the State of California
and from among those manufacturers who were made defend-
ants herein. The manufacturers and dealers were thus engaged
in the prosecution of a business which, with reference to the
sales of tiles, amounted to commerce between the States.
Under these circumstances the dealers in tiles, living in San
Franciso, or within a radius of 200 miles thereof, and being
someof the defendants in this action, together with the Eastern
manufacturers of tiles, who are named as defendants herein,
formed an association called The Tile, Mantel and Grate As-
sociation of California. The objects of the association, as
stated in the constitution thereof, were to unite all acceptable
dealers in tiles, fireplace fixtures and mantels in San Francisco
and vicinity, (within a radius or 200 miles,) and all American
manufacturers of tiles, and by frequent interchange of ideas
advance the interests and promote the mutual welfare of its
members.
By its constitution, article I, section 1, it was provided that
any individual, corporation or firm engaged in or contenplat-
ing engaging in the tile, mantel or grate business in San Fran-
cisco, or within a radius of 200 miles thereof, (not manufac-
turers,) having an established business and carrying not less
than $3,000 worth of stock, and having been proposed by a
member in good standing and elected, should, after having
signed the constitution and by-laws governing the association,
and upon the payment of an entrance fee as provided, enjoy
all the privileges of membership. It was provided in the sec-
ond section of the same article that all associated and individ-
ual manufacturers of tiles and fireplace fixtures throughout
the United States might become non-resident members of the
association upon the payment of an entrance fee as provided,
and after having signed the constitution and by-laws govern-
