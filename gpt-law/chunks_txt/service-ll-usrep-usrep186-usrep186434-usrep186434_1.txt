viding for the foreclosure and sale of the property and for the applica-
tion of th6 insurance moneys as prayed for. Upon appeal to the Circuit
Court of Appeals the decree of the Circuit Court was reversed as to the
insurance moneys, and the court below was directed to enter a decree that
those moneys should be paid to the defendant, The Penn Plate Glass Com-
pany. The material facts in the case are stated in the opinion of the
court. The only question involved arose from the provision made in the
decree by the Circuit Court judge, impressing what is termed an equita-
ble lien upon the insurance moneys collected on the policies taken out by
The Penn Company, sufficient to pay any balance which may remain un-
paid on the bonds secured by the mortgage to complainant, after the
application of the proceeds of the sale of the property mortgaged. The
Circuit Court held that the complainant had such equitable lien, while
the Circuit Court of Appeals was of the contrary opinion. Held that the
judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right.
