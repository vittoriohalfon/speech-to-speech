UNITED STATES v. FREIGHT ASSOCIATION. 341
Opinion of the Court.
tract or combination in restraint of trade or commerce, a
contract or combination made in violation of such law is
void, whatever may have been theretofore decided by the
courts to have been the public policy of the country on that
subject.
The conclusion which we have drawn from the examination
above made into the question before us is that the Anti-Trust
Act applies to railroads, and that it renders illegal all agree-
ments which are in restraint of trade or commerce as we have
above defined that expression, and the question then arises
whether the agreement before us is of that nature.
Although the case is- heard on bill and answer, thus mak-
ing it necessary to assume the truth of the allegations in the
answer which are well pleaded, yet the legal effect of the
agreement itself cannot be altered by the answer, nor can its
violation of law be made valid by allegations of good intention
or of desire to simply maintain reasonable rates; nor can the
plaintiffs' allegations as to the intent with which the agreement
was entered into be regarded, as such intent is denied on the
part of the defendants; and if the intent alleged in the bill
were a necessary fact to be proved in order to maintain the
suit, the bill would have to be dismissed. In the view we have
taken of the question, the intent alleged by the Government
is not necessary to be proved. The question is one of law
in regard to the meaning and effect of the agreement itself,
namely: Does the agreement restrain trade or commerce in
any way so as to be a violation of the act? We have no doubt
that it does. The agreement on its face recites that it is en-
tered into "for the purpose of mutual protection by establish-
ing and maintaining reasonable rates, rules and regulations on
all freight traffic, both through and locial." To that end the as-
sociation is formed and a body created which is to adopt rates,
which, when agreed to, are to be the governing rates for all
the companies, and a violation of which subjects the default-
ing company to the payment of a penalty, and although the
parties have a right to withdraw from the agreement on
giving thirty days' notice of a desire so to do, yet while in
force and assuming it to be lived up to, there can be no doubt

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.
that its direct, immediate and necessary effect is to put a
restraint upon trade or commerce as described in the act.
For these reasons the suit of the Government can be main-
tained without proof of the allegation that the agreement was
entered into for the purpose of restraining trade or commerce
or for maintaining rates above what was reasonable. The
necessary effect of the agreement is to restrain trade or com-
merce, no matter what the intent was on the part of those
who signed it.
One or two subsidiary questions remain to be decided.
It is said that to grant the injunction prayed for in this case
is to give the statute a retroactive effect; that the contract
at the time it was entered into was not prohibited or declared
illegal by the statute, as it had not then been passed; and to
now enjoin the doing of an act which was legal at the time it
was done would be improper. We give to the law no retro-
active effect. The agreement in question is a continuing one.
The parties to it adopt certain machinery, and agree to cer-
tain methods for the purpose of establishing and maintaining
in the future reasonable rates for transportation. Assuming
such action to have been legal'at the time the agreement was
first entered into, the continuation of the agreement, after
it has been declared to be illegal, becomes a violation of the
act. The statute prohibits the continuing or entering into
such an agreement for the future, and if the agreement be
continued it then becomes a violation of the act. There is
nothing of an ex post facto character about the act. The
civil remedy by injunction and the liability to punishment
under the criminal provisions of the act are entirely distinct,
and there can be no question of any act being regarded as a
violation of the statute which occurred before it was passed.
After its passage, if the law be violated, the parties violating
it may render themselves liable to be punished criminally;
but not otherwise.
It is also argued that the United States have no standing in
court to maintain this bill; that they have no pecuniary
interest in the result of the litigation or in the question to be
decided by the court. We think that the fourth section of

the act invests the Government with full power and authority
to bring such an action as this, and if the facts be proved, an
injunction should issue. Congress having the control of inter-
state commerce, has also the duty of protecting it, and it is
entirely competent for that body to give the remedy by in-
junction as more efficient than any other civil remedy. The
subject is fully and ably discussed in the case of In re 1Debs,
158 U. S. 564. See also Cincinnati, New Orleans &c. Rail-
way v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 162 U..S. 184; Texas
& Pacific Railway v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 162
Ti. S. 197.
For the reasons given, the decrees of the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals and of the Circuit Court for the Dis-
trict of Kansas must be
Reversed, and the case remanded to the Circuit Court for
furtherp roceedings in conformity with this opinion.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom concurred MR. JUSTICE
FIELD, MR. JUSTICE GRAY and MR. JUSTICE SHmAS, dissenting.
It is unnecessary to refer to the authorities showing that
although a contract may in some measure restrain trade, it is
not for that reason void or even voidable unless the restraint
which it produces be unreasonable. The opinion of the court
concedes this to be the settled doctrine.
The contract between the railway companies which the
court holds to be void because it is found to violate the act of
Congress of the 2d of July, 1890, 26 Stat. 209, substantially
embodies only an agreement between the corporations by
which a uniform classification of freight is obtained, by which
the secret under-cutting of rates is sought to be avoided, and
the rates as stated in the published rate sheets, and which, as
a general rule, are required by law to be filed with the Inter-
state Commerce Commission, are secured against arbitrary and
sudden changes. I content myself with giving this mere out-
line of the results of the contract, and do not stop to demon-
strate that its provisions are reasonable, since the opinion of
