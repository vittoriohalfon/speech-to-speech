NATIONAL COTTON OIL CO. v. TEXAS.
197 U. S. Opinion of the Court.
contended, as it is contended here, that this provision made
one law of the act and the act of 1895, and that the exemp-
tions of the latter became part of the former and made it un-
constitutional. In other words, the effect was (we quote
from the opinion of the court) "thereby to give exemption
from prosecution under the law of 1899 to those persons who
are exempted by the provisions of the law of 1895." The
Supreme Court of Texas rejected the contention. Its reason-
ing was not very direct or circumstantial, but it in effect held
that the act of 1899 did not continue the provisions of the
prior acts, whether constitutional or unconstitutional, merely
because it was declared to be cumulative. And the court de-
cided the law of 1899 to be constitutional, because it did not
contain the discriminating features of the prior laws. Under
the laws of Texas, therefore, combinations of the kind de-
scribed in the various anti-trust laws, whether by agricul-
turalists or organized laborers or others, are forbidden and
penalized, and the oil company is not discriminated against.
But it may be said that if the inequalities of prior anti-
trust acts have been removed by the act of 1899, they still
remain in the Revised Statutes of the State and in the Penal
Code, and by those Statutes and that Code the excepted classes
are exempted from indictment and punishment, while the oil
company is subject to both. We need not consider the Stat-
utes referred to or consider how far this discrimination can
exist, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court of the
State in State of Texas v. Laredo ice Company. Granting it
can exist, the case at bar is not a criminal -prosecution. It
involves only the anti-trust laws and their prohibitions, and
penalties. And in them, we have seen, by the effect of the
act of 1899 there is'no inequality of operation. It is the effect
of that decision also that the laws of the State against com-
binations and trusts are formed into a harmonious system, of
which the criminal provisions in other statutes and the Code
are a part, and that their provisions can be adjusted and
reconciled so as to have constitutional operation.
Judgment affirmed.
