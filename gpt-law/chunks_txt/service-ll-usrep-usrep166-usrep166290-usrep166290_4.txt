UNITED STATES v. FREIGHT ASSOCIATION. 299
Statement of the Case.
"And your orator further avers that on or about the fif-
teenth day of March, 1889, the defendants not being content
with the usual rates and prices for which they and others
were accustomed to move, carry and. transport property,
freight and commodities in the trade and commerce afore-
said and in their said business and occupation, but contriving
and intending unjustly and oppressively to increase and aug-
ment the said rates and prices, and to ,Lkunteract the effect
of free competition on the facilities and prices of transporta-
tion, and to establish and maintain arbitrary rates, and to
prevent any one of said defendants from reducing such arbi-
trary rates, and thereby exact and procure great sums of
money from the people of the said States and Territories
aforesaid, and from the people engaged in the interstate
commerce, trade and traffic within the region of country
aforesaid, and from all persons having goods, wares and mer-
chandise to be transported by said railroads, and intending
to monopolize the trade, traffic and commerce among and
between the States and Territories aforesaid, did combine,
conspire, confederate and unlawfully agree together, and did
then and there enter into a written' contract, combination,
agreement and compact, known as a memorandum of agree-
ment of the Trans-Missouri Freight Association, which was
signed by each of said above-named defendants."
The bill then set forth the agreement signed by the various
corporations defendant.
It was further alleged that the agreement went into effect on
the 1st day of April, 1889, and that since that time each and
all of the defendants, by reason of the agreement,-have put
into effect and kept in force upon the several lines of railroads
the rules and regulations and rates and prices for moving,
carrying and transporting freight fixed and established by
the association, and have declined and refused to fix or estab-
lish and maintain or give on their railroads rates and prices
for the carrying of freight based upon the cost of constructing
and maintaining their several lines of railroad and the cost
of carrying freights over the same, and such other elements
as should be considered in establishing tariff rates upon each

particular road, and the people of the States and Territories
subject to said association, and all persons engaged in trade
and commerce within, among and between the different States
and Territories had been compelled to and were still compelled
to pay the arbitrary rates of freight and submit to the arbi-
trary rules and regulations established and maintained by
the association, and ever since that date had been and still
were deprived of the benefits that might be expected to flow
from free competition between said several lines of transpor-
tation and communication, and were deprived of the better
facilities and cheaper rates of freight that might be reason-
ably expected to flow from free competition between the lines
above mentioned, and that the trade, traffic and commerce
in such region of country, and the freight traffic in connection
therewith, had been and were monopolized and restrained,
hindered, injured and retarded by the defendants by means
of and through the instrumentality of such association.
The bill further averred that notwithstanding the passage
of the act of Congress above mentioned on the 2d day of
July, 1890, the "defendants still continue in and still engage
in said unlawful combination and consp!racy, and still main-
tain said Trans-Missouri Freight Association, with all the
powers specified in the memorandum of agreement and articles
of association hereinbefore set forth, which said agreement,
combination and conspiracy so as aforesaid entered into and
maintained by said defendants is of great injury and grievous
prejudice to the common and public good and to the welfare
of the people of the United States."
The prayer of the bill was as follows:
"In consideration whereof, and inasmuch as your orator
can only have adequate relief in the premises in this honor-
able court where matters of this nature are properly cogni-
zable and relievable, your orator prays that this honorable
court may order, adjudge and decree that said Trans-Missouri
Freight Association be dissolved, and that said defendants,
and all and each of them, be enjoined and prohibited from
further agreeing, combining and conspiring and acting to-
getler to maintain rules and regulations and rates for carry-

ing freight upon their several lines of railroad to hinder trade
and commerce between the States and Territories' of the
United States, and that all and each of them be enjoined and
prohibited from entering or continuing in a combination, asso-
ciation or conspiracy to deprive the people engaged in trade
and commerce between and among the States and Territories
of the United States of such facilities and rates and charges
of freight transportation as will be afforded by free and un-
restrained competition between the said several lines of rail-
road, and that all and each of said defendants be enjoined
and prohibited from agreeing, combining and conspiring and
acting together to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the
freight traffic in the trade and commerce between the States
and Territories of the United States, and that all and each
of said defendants be enjoined and prohibited from agreeing,
combining and conspiring and acting together to prevent each
and any of their associates from carrying freight and com-
modities in the trade and commerce between the States and
Territories of the United States at such rates as shall be vol-
untarily fixed by the officers and agents of each of said roads
acting independently and separately in its own behalf."
The defendants were required to answer fully, etc., each
and all of the matters charged in the bill, but such answer
was not required to be under oath, an answer under oath
being specially waived.
The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway Company, the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway Company and the Den-
ver, Texas and Fort Worth Railroad Company denied being
parties to the association. The other fifteen companies filed
separate answers, each setting up substantially the same de-
fence.
They admitted they were common carriers engaged in the
transportation of persons and property in the States and
Territories mentioned in the agreement, and they alleged
that as such common carriers they were subject to the pro-
visions of the act of Congress, approved February 4, 1887,
c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, entitled "An act to regulate commerce,"
with the various amendments thereof and additions thereto,
