OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.
The whole opinion is a remarkably strong presentation of
the views of the learned judge who wrote it.
Still, again, it is answered that the effects of free compe-
tition among railroad companies, as described by the counsel
for the companies themselves in the course of their argument,
are greatly exaggerated. According to that argument, the
moment an agreement of this nature is prohibited the rail-
roads commence to cut their rates, and they cease only with
their utter financial ruin, leaving, perhaps, one to raise rates
indefinitely when its rivals have been driven away. It is said
that this is a most overdrawn statement, and that while abso-
lutely free competition may have in some instances and for a
time resulted in injury to some of the railroads, it is not at
all clear that the general result has been other than beneficial
to the whole public, and not in the long run detrimental to
the prosperity of the roads. It is matter of common knowl-
edge that agreements as to rates have been continually made
of late years, and that complaints of each company in regard
to the violation of such agreements by its rivals have been
frequent and persistent. Rate wars go on notwithstanding
any agreement to the contrary, and the struggle for business
among competing roads keeps on, and in the nature of things
will keep on, any alleged agreement to the contrary notwith-
standing, and it is only by the exercise of good sense and by
the presence of a common interest that railroads, without
entering into any affirmative agreement in regard thereto,
will keep within the limit of exacting a fair and reasonable
return for services rendered. These agreements have never
been found really effectual for any extended period.
The Interstate Commerce Commission, from whose reports
quotations have been quite freely made by counsel for the
purpose of proving the views of its learned members in re-
gard to this subject, has never distinctly stated that agree-
ments among competing railroads to maintain prices are to
be commended, or that the general effect is to be regarded
as beneficial. They have stated in their fourth annual report
that competition may degenerate into rate wars, and that
such -wars are as unsettling to the business of the country

as they are mischievous to the carriers, and that the spirit
of existing law is against them. They then add: "Agree-
ments between railroad companies which from time to time
they have entered into with a view to prevent such occur-
rences have never been found effectual, and for the very suf-
ficient reason, that the mental reservations in forming them
have been quite as numerous and more influential than the
written stipulations." It would seem true, therefore, that
there is no guaranty of financial health to be found in enter-
ing into agreements for the maintenance of rates, nor is finan-
cial ruin or insolvency the necessary result of their absence.
The claim that the company has the right to charge reason-
able rates, and that, therefore, it has the right to enter into
a combination with competing roads to maintain such rates,
cannot be admitted. The conclusion does not follow from an
admission of the premise. What one company may do in the
way of charging reasonable rates is radically different from
entering into an agreement with other and competing roads to
keep up the rates to that point. If there be any competition
the extent of the charge for the service will be seriously affected
by that fact. Competition will itself bring charges down to
what may be reasonable, while in the case of an agreement to
keep prices up, competition is allowed no play; it is shut out,
and the rate is practically fixed by the companies themselves
by virtue of the agreement, so long as they abide by it.
As a result of this review of the situation, we find two very
widely divergent views of the effects which might be expected
to result from declaring illegal all contracts in restraint of
trade, etc.; one side predicting financial disaster and ruin to
competing railroads, including thereby the ruin of share-
holders, the destruction of immensely valuable properties, and
the consequent prejudice to the public interest ; while on the
other side predictions equally earnest are made that no such
mournful results will follow, and it is urged that there is a
necessity, in order that the public interest may be fairly and
justly protected, to allow free and open competition among
railroads upon the subject of the rates for the transportation
of persons and property.

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court..
The arguments which have been addressed to us against
the inclusion of all contracts in restraint of trade, as provided
for by the language of the act, have been based upon the
alleged presumption that Congress, notwithstanding the lan-
guage of the act, could not have intended to embrace all con-
tracts, but only such contracts as were in unreasonable re-
straint of trade. Under these circumstances we are, therefore,
asked to hold that the act of Congress excepts contracts which
are not in unreasonable restraint of trade, and which only
keep rates up to a reasonable price, notwithstanding the
language of the act makes no such exception. In other
words, we are asked to read into the act by way of judicial
legislation an exception that is not placed there by the law-
making branch of the Government, and this is to be done
upon the theory that the impolicy of such legislation is so
clear that it cannot be supposed Congress intended the natural
import of the language it used. This we cannot and ought
not to do. That impolicy is not so clear, nor are the reasons
for the exception so potent as to permit us to interpolate an
exception into the language of the act, and to thus materially
alter its meaning and effect. It may be that the policy
.evidenced by the passage of the act itself will, if carried out,
result in disaster to the roads and in a failure to secure the
advantages sought from such legislation. Whether that will
be the result or not we do not know and cannot predict.
These considerations are, however, not for us. If the act
ought to read as contended for by defendants, Congress is the
body to amend it and not this court, by a process of judicial
legislation wholly unjustifiable. Large numbers do not agree
that the view taken by defendants is sound or true in sub-
stance, and Congress mfay and very probably did share in that
belief in passing the act. The public policy of the Govern-
ment is-to be found in its statutes, and when they have not
directly spoken, then in the decisions of the courts and the
constant practice of the government officials; but when the
lawmaking power speaks upon a particular subject, over which
it has constitutional power to legislate, public policy in such a
case is what the statute enacts. If the law prohibit any con-
