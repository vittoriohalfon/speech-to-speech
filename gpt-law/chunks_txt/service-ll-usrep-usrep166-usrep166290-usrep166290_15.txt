Opinion of the Court.
the reasonableness of the profit to be limited to a fair return
upon the capital that would have been sufficient to build and
equip the road, if honestly expended? Or is still another
standard to be created, and the reasonableness of the charges
tried by the cost of the carriage of the article and a reasonable
profit allowed on that? And in such case would contribution
to a sinking fund to make repairs upon the roadbed and
renewal of cars, etc., be assumed as a proper item? Or is the
reasonableness of the charge to be tested by reference to the
charges for the transportation of the same kind of property
made by other roads similarly situated? If the latter, a com-
bination among such roads as to rates would, of course, furnish
no means of answering the question. It is quite apparent,
therefore, that it is exceedingly difficult to formulate even the
terms of the rule itself which should govern in the matter of
determining what would be reasonable rates for transporta-
tion. While even after the standard should be determined
there is such an infinite variety of facts entering into the
question of what is a reasonable rate, no matter what stand-
ard is adopted, that any individual shipper would in most
cases be apt to abandon the effort to show the unreasonable
character of a charge, sooner than hazard the great expense
in time and money necessary to prove the fact, and at the
same time incur the ill-will of the road itself in all his future
dealings with it. To say, therefore, that the act excludes
agreements which are not in unreasonable restraint of trade,
and which tend simply to keep up reasonable rates for trans-
portation, is substantially to leave the question of reasonable-
ness to the companies themselves.
It must also be remembered that railways are public cor-
porations organized for public purposes, granted valuable
franchises and privileges, among which the right to take the
private property of the citizen in invitum is not the least,

their shareholders. The business which the railroads do is of
a public nature, closely affecting almost all classes in the com-
munity - the farmer, the artisan, the manufacturer and the
trader. It is of such a public nature that it may well be
doubted, to say the least, whether any contract which. imposes
any restraint upon its business would not be prejudicial to the
public interest.
We recognize the argument upon the part of the defendants
that restraint upon the business of railroads will not be preju-
dicial to the public interest so long as such restraint provides
for reasonable rates for transportation and prevents the deadly
competition so liable to result in the ruin of the roads and to
thereby impair their usefulness to the public, and in that way
to prejudice the public interest. But it must be remembered
that these results are by no means admitted with unanimity ;
on the contrary,, they are earnestly and warmly denied on the
part of the public and by those who assume to defend its
interests both in and out of Congress. Competition, they
urge, is a necessity for the purpose of securing in the end just
and proper rates.
It was said in Gibbs v. Baltimore Gas Company, 130 U. S.
396, at page 408, by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, as follows:
"The supplying of illuminating gas is a business of a public
nature to meet a public necessity. It is not a business like
that of an ordinary corporation engaged in the manufacture
of articles that may be furnished by individual effort. New

St. Louis v. St. Louis Gas Light Co., 70 Missouri, 69. Hence,
while it is justly urged that those rules which say that a given
contract is against public policy, should not be arbitrarily
extended so as to interfere with the freedom of contract,

sustain contracts imposing such restraint, however partial,
because in contravention of public policy. This subject is
much considered, and the authorities cited in West Virginia

600; Chicago &c. Gas 'Co. v. People's Gas Co., 121 Illinois,

It is true that in the Gibbs case there was a special statute
which prohibited the company from entering into any consoli-
dation, combination or contract with any other gas company
whatever, and it was provided that any attempt to do so or to
make such combination or contract should be utterly null and
void. The above extract from the opinion of the court is
made for the purpose of showing the difference which exists
between a private and a public corporation -that kind of a
public corporation which, while doing business for remunera-
tion, is yet so connected in interest with the public as to give
a public character to its business - and it is seen that while,
in the absence of a statute prohibiting them, contracts of
private individuals or corporations touching upon restraints
in trade must be unreasonable in their nature to be held void,
different considerations obtain in the case of public corpora-
tions like those of railroads where it well may be that any
restraint upon a business of that character as affecting its
rates of transportation must thereby be prejudicial to ithe
public interests.
The plaintiffs are, however, under no obligation in order
to maintain this action to show that by the common law all
agreements among competing railroad companies to keep up
rates to such as are reasonable were void as in restraint of
trade or commerce. There are many cases which look in
that direction if they do not precisely decide that point.
Some of them are referred to in the opinion in the Balti-
more Gas Company case, above cited. The case of the Mogul
Steamship Company v. McGregor, 21 Q. B. D. 544; 23 Q. B. D.
598; 1892, App. Cas. 25, has been cited by the courts be-
low as holding in principle that contracts of this nature are
valid at common law. The agreement held valid there was
