UNITED STATES v. FREIGHT ASSOCIATION. 359
Dissenting Opinion: White, Field, Gray, Shiras, JJ.
Prior to the passage of the act of 1890, various reports had
been made to Congress concerning the operations of the Inter-
state Commerce Act, in which the commission pointed out the
desirability and necessity of contracts between railroad com-
panies in the matter of classification, stable rates, etc. After
the act of 1890 had been adopted in the Senate, it was
amended in the House of Representatives so as to specifically
include among the contracts declared lawful "contracts for
the transportation of persons or property from one State or
Territory into another." Cong. Rec. vol. 21, part 5, pp. 4099,
4144. On the return of the bill to the Senate the amendment
was agreed to with the added provision that the contracts for
transportation to be prohibited, "should only be such as raise
the rates of transportation above what is just and reasonable."
lb. 4753. The House refused to concur in the Senate amend-
ment. A conference committee was appointed by both bodies,
which recommended that the House of Representatives recede
from its disagreement to the amendments of the Senate and
agree to the same, modified by the addition of the provision
that "nothing in this act shall be deemed or held to impair
the powers of the several States in respect to any of the
matters in this act mentioned." In a statement accompany-
ing the report, Mr. Stewart, for the conferees on the part of
the Htouse, said :
"A majority of the committee of conference on the part
of the Hlouse on the disagreeing votes of the two houses on
Senate bill one, submit the following statement-:
"In the original bill two things were declared illegal,
namely: contracts in restraint of interstate trade or com-
merce, and the monopolization of such trade.
"Its only object was the control of trusts, so called, so far
as such combinations in their relation to interstate trade are
within reach of Federal legislation.
"The House amendment extends the scope of the act to all
agreements entered into for the purpose of preventing com-
petition, either in the purchase or sale of commodities, or in
the transportation of persons or property within the juris-
diction of Congress.

"It declares illegal any agreement for relief from the
effects of competition in the two industries of transporta-
tion and merchandising, however excessive or destructive such
competition may be.
"The amendment reported by the conferees is the Senate.
amendment with the added proviso that the power of the
States over the subjects embraced in the act shall not be im-
paired thereby.
"It strikes from the House amendment the clause relating
to contracts for the purchase of merchandise, and modifies the
transportation clause by making unlawful agreements which
raise rates, above what is just and reasonable." Cong. Rec.
vol. 21, part 6, p. 5950.
The House rejected the report of the confefence committee
and adhered to its amendments. A new conference com-
mittee was appointed, and the recommendation of that com-
mittee that both houses recede was concurred in, and the bill
as it originally passed the Senate was adopted. Cong. Rec.
vol. 21, part 9, p. 6212.
It thus appears that the bill was originally introduced in
the form ia which it now appears; that this form was
thought not to be sufficient to embrace railroad transportation,
and that a determined effort was made by the proposed
amendment to include such contracts, and that, the effort was
unsuccessful. The reports to Congress by the commission and
by the conference committee being facts proper to ,be noticed
in seeking to ascertain the intention of Congress, Church of
-Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U. S. 457, it would seem
to be manifest therefrom that there was no intention by the
act to interfere with the control and regulation of railroads
under the. Interstate Commerce Act "or with acts of the com-
panies which had therefore 'been recognized as in conformity
to and not in conflict with that act.
That there was and could have been no intention to repeal
by the act of 1890 the earlier "act to regulate interstate com-
merce" is additionally evidenced by the fact that no reference
is made in the later act to the prior one, and that no language
is contained in the act of 1890 Which could in any way be con-

strued as abrogating any of the rights conferred or powers
called into existence by the Interstate Commerce Act. No-
where, contemporaneous with the act of 1890, is there any-
thing indicating that any one supposed that the provisions of
that act were intended to repeal the Interstate Commerce Act.
The understanding of Congress in this respect is shown by the
circumstance that the Interstate Commerce Act has been
amended in material particulars and treated as existing since
the adoption of the act of 1890; and this conception of the
legislative department of the Government has also been that
entertained by the executive and judicial departments, evi-
denced by the appointment of new members of the commis-
sion, and by decisions of the courts enforcing various provisions
of that act, and treating it as still subsisting in its entirety.
The two laws then coexisting - is the agreement of the carriers
to secure a uniform classification of freight and to prevent
secret changes of the published rates, in other words, to secure
just and fair dealings between each other, sanctioned by the
act to regulate interstate commerce, and, therefore, not within
the inhibition of the act of 1890 ?
The Interstate Commerce Act provided for the appoint-
ment of a commission to whom was to be confided the super-
vision of the execution of the law. Without going into
detailed mention of the provisions of the statute, I adopt
and quote the summary statement of the leading features of
the original act contained in the first annual report made to
Congress by the commission, as required by the act. It is as
follows:
"All charges made for services by carriers subject to the act
must be reasonable and just. Every unjust and unreasonable
charge is prohibited and declared to be unlawful.
"The direct or indirect charging, demanding, collecting or
receiving for any. service rendered a greater or less compensa-
tion from any one or more persons than from any other for a
like and contemporaneous service, is declared to be unjust dis-
crimination and is prohibited.
"The giving of any undue or unreasonable preferences, as
between persons or localities, or kinds of traffic, or the subject-
