-sities of over 60,000,000 people. The article thus completely
under their control, for the last fifty years, has come to be
regarded as one of necessity, not only in every household in
the land, but one of daily use by almost every individual in
the country It is difficult to conceive of a monopoly which
-can affect a greater number of people, or one more extensive
in its effect on the country, than that of the Diamond Match
Company It was to aid that company in its purposes and in
-carrying out its object that the contract in this case was made
between those parties, which we are now asked to aid in
,enforcing. Monopoly in trade, or in any kind of business in
this country, is odious to our form of government. It is some-
times permitted to aid the government in carrying on a great
public enterprise or public work under governmental control
in the interest of the public. Its tendency is, however, de-
â€¢structive of free institutions and repugnant to the instincts of
a free people, and contrary to the whole scope and spirit of
the Federal Constitution, and is not allowed to exist under
express provisions in several of our state constitutions.
All combinations among persons or corporations for the pur-
pose of raising or controlling the prices of merchandise, or
any of the necessaries of life, are monopolies and intolerable,
-and ought to receive the condemnation of all courts."
In the same case, Mr. Justice Champlin, with whom Mr.
Justice Campbell concurred, said "There is no doubt that
all the parties to this suit were active participants in perfect-
ing the combination called 'The Diamond Match Company,'
and that the present dispute grows out of that transaction,
and is the fruit of the scheme by which all competition in the
manufacture of matches was stifled, opposition in the business
,crushed, and the whole business of the country in that line
engrossed by the Diamond Match Company Such a vast
combination 'as has been entered into under the above name
is a menace to the public. Its object and direct tendency is to
prevent free and fair competition, and control prices through-
out the national domain. It is no answer to say that this
monopoly has in fact reduced the price of friction matches.
That policy may have been necessary to crush competition.

Dissenting Opinion. Harlan, J.
The fact exists that it rests in the discretion of this company
at any time to raise the price to an exorbitant degree. Such
combinations have frequently been condemned by courts as
unlawful and against public policy" See also Raymond v
Leavdtt, 46 Michigan, 447, and Texas Standard Oil Co. v
Adoue, 83 Texas, 650.
This extended reference to adjudged cases relating to unlaw-
ful restraints upon the interior traffic of a State has been made
for the purpose of showing that a combination such as that
organized under the name of the American Sugar Refining Com-
pany has been uniformly held by the courts of the States to
be against public policy and illegal because of its necessary
tendency to impose improper restraants upon trade. And
such, I take it, would be the judgment of any Circuit Court
of the United States in a case between parties in which it
became necessary to determine the question. The judgments
of the state courts rest upon general principles of law, and not
necessarily upon statutory provisions expressly condemning
restraints of trade imposed by or resulting from combina-
tions. Of course, in view of the authorities, it will not be
doubted that it would be competent for a State, under the
power to regulate its domestic commerce and for the pur-
pose of protecting its people against fraud and injustice, to
make it a public offence punishable by fine and imprisonment,
for individuals or corporations to make contracts, form com-
binations, or engage in conspiracies, which unduly restrain
trade or commerce carried on within its limits, and also to
authorize the institution of proceedings for the purpose of
annulling contracts of that character, as well as of preventing
or restraining such combinations and conspiracies.
But there is a trade among the several States which is dis-
tinct from that carried on within the territorial limits of a
State. The regulation and control of the former is committed
by the national Constitution to Congress. Commerce among
the States, as this court has declared, is a unit, and in respect
of that commerce this is one country, and we are one people.
It may be regulated by rules applicable to every part of the
United States, and state lines and state jurisdiction cannot

interfere with the enforcement of such rules. The jurisdic-
tion of the general government extends over every foot of
territory within the United States. Under the power with
which it is invested, Congress may remove unlawful obstruc-
tions, of whatever kind, to the free course of trade among the
States. In so doing it would not interfere with the "auton-
omy of the States," because the power thus to protect inter-
state commerce is expressly given by the people of all the
States. Interstate intercourse, trade, and traffic is absolutely
free, except as such intercourse, trade, or traffic may be inci-
dentally or indirectly affected by the exercise by the States of
their reserved police powers. Sherlook v Alling, 93 U *. 99,
103. It is the Constitution, the supreme law of the land,
which invests Congress with power to protect commerce
among the States against burdens and exactions arising from
unlawful restraints by whatever authority imposed. Surely
a right secured or granted by that instrument is under the
protection of the government which that instrument creates.
Any combination, therefore, that disturbs or unreasonably
obstructs freedom in buying and selling articles manufactured
to be sold to persons in other States or to be carried to other
States - a freedom that cannot exist if the right to buy and
sell is fettered by unlawful restraints that crush out competi-
tion - affects, not incidentally, but directly, the people of all
the States, and the remedy for such an evil is found only in
the exercise of powers confided to a government which, this
court has said, was the government of all, exercising powers
delegated by all,.representing all, acting for all. .MeCulloch
v .Mairyland,4 Wheat. 316, 405.
It has been argued that a combination between corporations
of different States, or between the stockholders of such cor-
porations, with the object and effect of controlling not simply
the manufacture but the price of refined sugar throughout the
whole of the United States- which is the case now before us
- cannot be held to be in restraint of "commerce among the
States" and amenable to national authority, without conced-
ing that, the general government has authority to say what
shall and what shall not be manufactured in the several States.
