OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
HARLAN, J., Affirming Decree. 193 U. S.
That to vitiate a combination, such as the act of Congress
condemns, it need not be shown that the combination, in fact,
results or will result in a total suppression of trade or in a com-
plete monopoly, but it is only essential to show that by its
necessary operation it tends to restrain interstate or interna-
tional trade or commerce or tends to create a monopoly in
such trade or commerce and to deprive the public of the ad-
vantages that flow from free competition;
That the constitutional guarantee of liberty of contract does
not prevent Congress from prescribing the rule of free compe-
tition for those engaged in interstate and international com-
merce; and,
That under its power to regulate commerce among the sev-
eral States and with foreign nations, Congress had authority
to enact the statute in question.
No one, we assume, will deny that these propositions were
distinctly announced in the former decisions of this court.
They cannot be ignored or their effect avoided by the intima-
tion that the court indulged in obiter dicta. What was said in
those cases was within the limits of the issues made by the
parties. In our opinion, the recognition of the principles an-
nounced in former cases must, under the conceded facts, lead
to an affirmance of the decree below, unless the special objec-
tions, or some of them, which have been made to the applica-
tion of the act of Congress to the present case are of a sub-
stantial character. We will now consider those objections.
Underlying the argument in behalf of the defendants is the
idea that as the Northern Securities Company is a state cor-
poration, and as its acquisition of the stock of the Great
Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies is not in-
consistent with the powers conferred by its charter, the en-
forcement of the act of Congress, as against those corporations,
will be an unauthorized interference by the national govern-
ment with the internal commerce of the States creating those
corporations. This suggestion does not at all impress us.
There is no reason to suppose that Congress had any purpose

to interfere with the internal affairs of the States, nor, in our
opinion, is there any ground whatever for the contention that
the Anti-Trust Act regulates their domestic commerce. By its
very terms the act regulates only commerce among the States
and with foreign states. Viewed in that light, the act, if
within the powers of Congress, must be respected; for, by the
explicit words of the Constitution, that instrument and the
laws enacted by Congress in pursuance of its provisions, are
the supreme law of the land, "anything in the constitution
or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding"-
supreme over the States, over the courts,, and even over the
people of the United States, the source of all power under our
governmental system in respect of the objects for which the
National Government was ordained. An act of Congress con-
stitutionally passed under its power to regulate commerce
among the States and with foreign nations is binding upon all;
as much so as if it were embodied, in terms, in the Constitu-
tion itself. Every judicial officer, whether of a national or a
state court, is under the obligation of an oath so to regard a
lawful enactment of Congress. Not even a State, still less one
of its artificial creatures, can stand in the way of its enforce-
ment. If it were otherwise, the Government and its laws
might be prostrated at the feet of local authority. Cohens v.
Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 385, 414. These views have been
often expressed by this court.
It is said that whatever may be the power of a State over
such subjects Congress cannot forbid single individuals from
disposing of their stock in a state corporation, even if such
corporation be engaged in interstate and international com-
merce; that the holding or purchase by a state corporation,
or the purchase by individuals, of the stock of another corpo-
ration, for whatever purpose, are matters in respect of which
Congress has no authority under the Constitution; that, so
far as the power of Congress is concerned, citizens or state
corporations may dispose of their property and invest their
money in any way they choose; and that in regard to all

such matters, citizens and state corporations are subject, if to
any authority, only to the lawful authority of the State in
which such citizens reside, or under whose laws such corpora-
tions are organized. It is unnecessary in this case to con-
sider such abstract, general questions. The court need not
now concern itself with them. They are not here to be ex-
amined and determined, and may well be left for consideration
in some case necessarily involving their determination.
In this connection, it is suggested that the contention of the
Government is that the acquisition and ownership of stock in
a state railroad corporation is itself interstate commerce, if
that corporation be engaged in interstate commerce. This
suggestion is made in different ways, sometimes in express
words, at other times by implication. For instance, it is said
that the question here is whether the power of Congress over
interstate commerce extends to the regulation of the owner-
ship of the stock in state railroad companies, by reason of
their being engaged in such commerce. Again, it is said that
the only issue in this case is whether the Northern Securities
Company can acquire and hold stock in other state corpora-
tions. Still further, is it asked, generally, whether the organi-
zation or ownership of railroads is not under the control of
the States under whose laws they came into existence? Such
statements as to the issues in this case are, we think, wholly
unwarranted and are very wide of the mark; it is the setting
up of mere men of straw to be easily stricken down. We (o
not understand that the Government makes any such con-
tentions or takes any such positions as those statements imply.
It does not contend that Congress may control the mere ac-
quisition or the mere ownership of stock in a state corpora-
tion engaged in interstate commerce. Nor does it contend
that Congress can control the organization of state corporations
authorized by their charters to engage in interstate and inter-
national commerce. But it does contend that Congress may
protect the freedom of interstate commerce by any means
that are appropriate and that are lawful and not prohibited
