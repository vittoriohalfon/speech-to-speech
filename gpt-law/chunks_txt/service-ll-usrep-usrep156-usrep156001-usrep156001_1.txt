UNITED STATES v. E. 0. KNIGHT COMPANY
.APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD
CIRCUIT.
Wo. 675. Argued October 24, 194.-Decided January 21, 1295.
The monopoly and restraint denounced by the act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26
Stat. 209, "to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints
and monopolies," are a monopoly in interstate and international trade
or commerce, and not a monopoly in the manufacture of a necessary of
life.
The American Sugar Refining Company, a corporation existing under the
laws of the State of New Jersey, being in control of a large ma3ority of
the manufactories of refined sugar in the United States, acquired, through
the purchase of stock in four Philadelphia refineries, such disposition
over those manufactories throughout the United States as gave it a
practical monopoly of the business. Held, that the result of the transac-
tion was the creation of a monopoly in the manufacture of a necessary
of life, which could not be suppressed under the provisions of the act
of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209, " to protect trade and commerce
against unlawful restraints and monopolies," in the mode attempted in
this suit; and that the acquisition of Philadelphia refineries by a New
Jersey corporation, and the business of sugar refining in Pennsylvania,
bear no direct relation to commerce between the States or with foreign
nations.

Statement of the Case.
THIS was a bill filed by the United States against E. 0.
Knight Company and others, in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charg-
ing that the defendants had violated the provisions of an act
of Congress approved July 2, 1890, c. 647, entitled "An act to
protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints
and monopolies," 26 Stat. 209, "providing that every con-
tract, combination in the form of trust, or otherwise, or
conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce among the
several States is illegal, and that persons who shall monopolize
or shall attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with
other persons to monopolize trade and commerce among the
several States, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor." The bill
alleged that the defendant, the American Sugar Refining
Company, was incorporated under and by virtue of the laws
of New Jersey, whose certificate of incorporation named the
places in New Jersey and New York at which its principal
business was to be transacted, and several other States in
which it proposed to carry on operations, and stated that the
objects for which said company was formed were "the pur
chase, manufacture, refining, and sale of sugar, molasses, and
melads, and all lawful business incidental thereto," that the
defendant, E. C. Knight Company, was incorporated under
the laws of Pennsylvania "for the purpose of importing, man-
ufacturing, refining and dealing in sugars and molasses," at
the city of Philadelphia, that the defendant, the Franklin
Sugar Company, was incorporated under the laws of Penn-
sylvania "for the purpose of the manufacture of sugar and
the purchase of raw material for that purpose," at Philadel-
phia, that the defendant, Spreckels Sugar Refining Company,
was incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania "for the
purpose of refining sugar, which will involve the buying of
the raw material therefor and selling the manufactured
product, and of doing whatever else shall be incidental to
the said business of refining," at the city of Philadelphia,
that the defendant, the Delaware Sugar House, was incorpo-
rated under the laws of Pennsylvania "for the purpose of the
manufacture of sugar and syrups, and preparing the same for

market, and the transaction of such work or business as may
be necessary or proper for the proper management of the
business of manufacture."
It was further averred that the four defendants last named
were independently engaged in the manufacture and sale of
sugar until on or about March 4, 1892, that the product of
their refineries amounted to thirty-three per cent of the sugar
refined m the United States, that they were competitors
with the American Sugar Refimng Company, that the prod-
ucts of their several refineries were distributed among the sev-
eral States of the United States, and that all the companies
were engaged in trade or commerce with the several States
and with foreign nations, that the American Sugar Refining
Company had,. on or prior to March 4, 1892, obtained the con-
trol of all the sugar refineries of the United States with the
exception of the Revere of Boston, and the refineries of the four
defendants above mentioned, that the Revere produced annu-
ally about two per cent of the total amount of sugar refined.
The bill then alleged that in order that the American Sugar
Refining Company might obtain complete control of the price
of sugar in the United States, that company, and John E.
Searles, Jr., acting for it, entered into an unlawful and fraudu-
lent scheme to purchase the stock, machinery, and real estate
of the other four corporations defendant, by which they at-
tempted to control all the sugar refineries for the purpose of
restraining the trade thereof with other States as theretofore
carried on independently by said defendants, that in pur-
suance of this scheme, on or about March 4, 1892, Searles
entered into a contract with the defendant Knight Company
and individual stockholders named, for the purchase of all
the stock of that company, and subsequently delivered to the
defendants therefor in exchange shares of the American Sugar
Refining Company, that on or about the same date Searles
entered into a similar contract with the Spreckels Company
and individual stockholders, and with the Franklin Company
and stockholders, and with the Delaware Sugar House and
stockholders. It was further averred that the American
Sugar Refining Company monopolized the manufacture and
