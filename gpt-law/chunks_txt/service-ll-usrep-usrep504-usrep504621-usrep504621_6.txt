late their economies in many ways not inconsistent with the
antitrust laws. For example, Oregon may provide for peer
review by its physicians without approving anticompetitive
conduct by them. See Patrick, 486 U. S., at 105. Or Mich-
igan may regulate its public utilities without authorizing
monopolization in the market for electric light bulbs. See
Cantorv . DetroitE dison Co., 428 U. S. 579,596 (1976). So we
have held that state-action immunity is disfavored, much as
are repeals by implication. Lafayette v. LouisianaP ower &
Light Co., 435 U. S. 389, 398-399 (1978). By adhering in
most cases to fundamental and accepted assumptions about
the benefits of competition within the framework of the anti-
trust laws, we increase the States' regulatory flexibility.
States must accept political responsibility for actions they
intend to undertake. It is quite a different matter, however,
for federal law to compel a result that the States do not in-
tend but for which they are held to account. Federalism
serves to assign political responsibility, not to obscure it.
Neither federalism nor political responsibility is well served
by a rule that essential national policies are displaced by
state regulations intended to achieve more limited ends.
For States which do choose to displace the free market with
regulation, our insistence on real compliance with both parts
of the Midcal test will serve to make clear that the State is
responsible for the price fixing it has sanctioned and under-
taken to control.
Respondents contend that these concerns are better ad-
dressed by the requirement that the States articulate a clear
policy to displace the antitrust laws with their own forms
of economic regulation. This contention misapprehends the
close relation between Midcal's two elements. Both are di-
rected at ensuring that particular anticompetitive mecha-
nisms operate because of a deliberate and intended state pol-
icy. See Patrick,s upra,a t 100. In the usual case, Midcal's
requirement that the State articulate a clear policy shows
little more than that the State has not acted through inad-

vertence; it cannot alone ensure, as required by our prece-
dents, that particular anticompetitive conduct has been ap-
proved by the State. It seems plain, moreover, in light of
the amici curiae brief to which we have referred, that sole
reliance on the requirement of clear articulation will not
allow the regulatory flexibility that these States deem neces-
sary. For States whose object it is to benefit their citizens
through regulation, a broad doctrine of state-action immu-
nity may serve as nothing more than an attractive nuisance
in the economic sphere. To oppose these pressures, sole re-
liance on the requirement of clear articulation could become
a rather meaningless formal constraint.

In the case before us, the Court of Appeals relied upon a
formulation of the active supervision requirement articu-
lated by the First Circuit:
"'Where ... the state's program is in place, is staffed
and funded, grants to the state officials ample power and
the duty to regulate pursuant to declared standards of
state policy, is enforceable in the state's courts, and dem-
onstrates some basic level of activity directed towards
seeing that the private actors carry out the state's policy
and not simply their own policy, more need not be estab-
lished."' 922 F. 2d, at 1136, quoting New England
Motor Rate Bureau, Inc. v. FTC, 908 F. 2d, at 1071.
Based on this standard, the Third Circuit ruled that the ac-
tive supervision requirement was met in all four States, and
held that the respondents' conduct was entitled to state-
action immunity from antitrust liability. 922 F. 2d, at 1140.
While in theory the standard articulated by the First Cir-
cuit might be applied in a manner consistent with our prece-
dents, it seems to us insufficient to establish the requisite
level of active supervision. The criteria set forth by the
First Circuit may have some relevance as the beginning

point of the active state supervision inquiry, but the analysis
cannot end there. Where prices or rates are set as an initial
matter by private parties, subject only to a veto if the State
chooses to exercise it, the party claiming the immunity must
show that state officials have undertaken the necessary steps
to determine the specifics of the price-fixing or ratesetting
scheme. The mere potential for state supervision is not
an adequate substitute for a decision by the State. Under
these standards, we must conclude that there was no active
supervision in either Wisconsin or Montana.
Respondents point out that in Wisconsin and Montana the
rating bureaus filed rates with state agencies and that in
both States the so-called negative option rule prevailed.
The rates became effective unless they were rejected within
a set time. It is said that as a matter of law in those States
inaction signified substantive approval. This proposition
cannot be reconciled, however, with the detailed findings, en-
tered by the ALJ and adopted by the Commission, which
demonstrate that the potential for state supervision was not
realized in fact. The ALJ found, and the Commission
agreed, that at most the rate filings were checked for mathe-
matical accuracy. Some were unchecked altogether. In
Montana, a rate filing became effective despite the failure of
the rating bureau to provide additional requested informa-
tion. In Wisconsin, additional information was provided
after a lapse of seven years, during which time the rate filing
remained in effect. These findings are fatal to respondents'
attempts to portray the state regulatory regimes as provid-
ing the necessary component of active supervision. The
findings demonstrate that, whatever the potential for state
regulatory review in Wisconsin and Montana, active state
superYision did not occur. In the absence of active supervi-
sion in fact, there can be no state-action immunity for what
were otherwise private price-fixing arrangements. And as
in Patrick, the availability of state judicial review could not
fill the void. Because of the state agencies' limited role and
