dizement as against the public interest. In business or trad-
ing combinations they may even temporarily, or perhaps
permanently, reduce the price of the article traded in or
manufactured, by reducing the expense inseparable from the
running of many different companies for the same purpose.
Trade or commerce under those circumstances may neverthe-
less be badly and unfortunately restrained by driving out of
business the small dealers and worthy men whose lives have
been spent therein, and who might be unable to readjust
themselves to their altered surroundings. Mere reduction in
the price of the commodity dealt in might be dearly paid
for by the ruin of such a class, and the absorption of control
over one commodity by an all-powerful combination of capital.
In any great and extended change in the manner or method
of doing business it seems to be an inevitable necessity that
distress and, perhaps, ruin shall be its accompaniment in re-
gard to some of those who were engaged in the old methods.
A change from stage coaches and canal boats to railroads
threw at once a large number of men out of employment;
changes from hand labor to that of machinery, and from
operating machinery by hand to the application of steam for
such purpose, leave behind them for the time a number of
men who must seek other avenues of livelihood. These are
misfortunes which seem to be the necessary accompaniment
of all great industrial changes. It takes time to effect a re-
adjustment of industrial life so that those who are thrown
out of their old employment, by reason of such changes as
we' have spoken of, may find opportunities for labor in other
departments than those to which they have been accustomed.
It is a misfortune, but yet in such cases it seems to be the
inevitable accompaniment of change and improvement.
It is wholly different, however, when such changes are
effected by combinations of capital, whose purpose in com-
bining is to control the production or manufacture of any
particular article in the market, and by such control dictate
the price at which the article shall be sold, the effect being
to drive out of business all the small dealers in the commodity
and to render the public subject to the decision of the com-

bination as to what price shall be paid for the article. In
this light it is not material that the price of an article may
be lowered. It is in the power of the combination to raise
it, and the result in any event is unfortunate for the country
by depriving it of the services of a large number of small but
independent dealers who were familiar with the business and
who had spent their lives in it, and who supported themselves
and their families from the small profits realized therein.
Whether they be able to find other avenues to earn their
livelihood is not so material, because it is not for the real
prosperity of any country that such changes should occur
which result in transferring an independent business man,
the head of his establishment, small though it might be, into
a mere servant or agent of a corporation for selling the com-
modities which he once manufactured or dealt in, having no
voice in shaping the business policy of the company and
bound to obey orders issued by others. Nor is it for the
substantial interests of the country that any one commodity
should be within the sole power and subject to the sole will
of one powerful combination of capital. Congress has, so far
as its jurisdiction extends, prohibited all contracts or com-
binations in the form of trusts entered into for the purpose
of restraining trade and commerce. The results naturally
flowing from a contract or combination in restraint of trade
or commerce, when entered into by a manufacturing or trad-
ing company such as above stated, while differing somewhat
from those which may follow a contract to keep up trans-
portation rates by railroads, are nevertheless of the same
nature and kind, and the contracts themselves do not so far
differ in their nature that they may not all be treated alike
and be condemned in common. It is entirely appropriate
generally to subject corporations or persons engaged in trad-
ing or manufacturing to different rules from those applicable
to railroads in their transportation business; but when the
evil to be remedied is similar in both kinds of corporations,
such as contracts which are unquestionably in restraint of
trade, we see no reason why similar rules should not be pro-
mulgated in regard to both, and both be covered in the same

statute by general language sufficiently broad to include them
both. We see nothing either in contemporaneous history, in
the legal situation at the time of the passage of the statute,
in its legislative history, or in any general difference in the
nature or kind of these trading or manufacturing companies
from railroad companies, which would lead us to the conclu-
sion that it cannot be supposed the legislature in prohibiting
the making of contracts in restraint of trade intended to in-
clude railroads within the purview of that act.
Neither is the statute, in our judgment, so uncertain in its
meaning, or its language so vague, that it ought not to be held
applicable to railroads. It prohibits contracts, combinations,
etc., in restraint of trade or commerce. Transporting com-
modities is ,commerce, and if from one State to or through
another it is interstate commerce. To be reached by the
Federal statute it must be commerce among the several
States or with foreign nations. When the act prohibits con-
tracts in restraint of trade or commerce, the plain meaning
of the language used includes contracts which relate to either
or both subjects. Both trade and commerce are included so
long as each relates to that which is interstate or foreign.
Transportation of commodities among the several States or
with foreign nations falls within the description of the words
of the statute with regard to that subject, and there is also
included in that language that kind of trade in commodities
among the States or with foreign nations which is not con-
fined to their mere transportation. It includes their purchase
and sale. Precisely at what point in the course of the trade
in or manufacture of commodities the statute may have effect
upon them, or upon contracts relating to them, may be some-
what difficult to determine, but interstate transportation
presents no difficulties. In United States v. E. CK night
Co. 156 U. S. 1, heretofore cited, it was in substance held,
reiterating the language of Mr. Justice Lamar in KRidd v.
Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, that the intent to manufacture or
export a manufactured article to foreign nations or to send
it to another State did not determine the time when the
article or product passed from the control of the State and
