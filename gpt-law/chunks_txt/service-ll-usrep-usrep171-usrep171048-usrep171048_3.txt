OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.
1; Central Transportation Co. v. Pullman Palace Car Co.,
139 U. S. 24.
The powef, therefore, must be granted in express words
or necessarily-to be implied. What does the latter mean?
Mr. Justice Jackson, in Grand Rapid &c. Power Co. v.
Grand Rapid &c. Co., supra,' says: . . . '"t hat munici-
pal corporations possess and can exercise only such powers
as are 'granted in express words, or those necessarly or
fairly implied, in or incident to the powers expressly con-
ferred, or those essential "to. the declared objects and purposes
of the corporation,n ot simply convenient, but indispensable."
The italics are his. This would make "necessarily implied"
mean inevitably implied. The Court of Appeals of the. Sixth
Circuit, by Circuit Judge Lurton, adopts Lord Eardwicke's
explanation, quoted by Lord Eldon in Wilkinson v. Adam,
1 Ves. & B. 422, 466, that "a necessary implication means
not natural necessity, but so strong a probability of intention,
that an intention contrary to that, which is imputed to the
testator, cannot be supposed." If this be more than -express-
ing by circumlocution an inevitable necessity, we need nor
stop to remark; or if it mean less, to sanction it, because we
think that the statute of Michigan, tested by it, does not con-
fer on the common council of Detroit the power it attempted
to exercise in the ordinance of 1862. To refer the right to
occupy the streets of any town or city to the consent of its
local government was natural enough -would have been nat-
ural under any constitution not prohibiting it, and the power
to prescribe the terms and regulations of the occupation de-
rive very little if any breadth from the expression of it. But
assuming the power to prescribe terms does acquire breadth
from such expression, surely there is sufficient range for its
exercise which stops short, or which rather does not extend
to granting an exclusive privilege of occupation. Surely there
is not so strong a probability of an intention of granting so
extreme a power that one, contrary to it cannot be supposed,
which -is Lord Hardwicke's test, or that it is indispensable to
the purpose for which the power is given or necessarily to be
implied from it which is the test of the cases. The rule is one

of construction. Any grant of power in general terms read
literally can be construed to be unlimited, but it may, notwith-
standing, receive limitation from its purpose- from the gen
eral purview of the act which confers it. A municipality is a
governmental agency - its functions are for the public good,
and the powers given to it and to be exercised by it must be
construed with reference to that good and to the distinctions
which are recognized as important in the administration of
public affairs.
Easements in the public streets for a limited time- are differ-
ent and have different consequences from those given in per-
petuity. Those reserved from monopoly are different and
have differeit consequences from those fixed in monopoly.
Consequently those given in perpetuity and in monopoly
must have for their authority explicit permission, or, if in-
ferred from other powers, it isn"o t enough that the authority
is convenient to them, but it must be indispensable to them.
