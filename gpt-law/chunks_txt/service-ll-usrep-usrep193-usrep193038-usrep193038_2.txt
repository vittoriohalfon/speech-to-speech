ing the association. The initiation fee was, for active members,
$25, and for non-resident members $10, and each active mem-
her of the association was to pay $10 per year as dues, but no
dues were charged against non-residents.
An executive committee was to be appointed, whose duty
it was to examine all applications for membership in the as-
sociation and report on the same to the association. It does
not appear what vote was necessary to elect a member, but it
is alleged in the complaint that it required the unanimous con-
sent of the association to become a member thereof, and it
was further alleged that by reason of certain business diffi-
culties there were members of the association who were an-
tagonistic to plaintiffs, and who would not have permitted
them to join, if they had applied, and that plaintiffs were not
eligible to join the association for the further reason that they
did not carry at all times stock of the value of $3,000.
The by-laws, after providing for the settlement of disputes
between the members and their customers, by reason of liens,
foreclosure proceedings, etc., enacted as follows, in article
III :
"SEc. '7. No dealer and active member of this association
shall purchase, directly or indirectly, any tile or fireplace fix-
tures from any manufacturer or resident or traveling agent of
any manufacturer not a member of this association, neither
shall they sell or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any unset
tile for less than list prices to any person or persons not a inem-
ber of this association, under penalty of expulsion from the
association.
" SEc. 8. Manufacturers of tile or fireplace fixtures or resi-
dent or traveling agents or manufacturers selling or disposing,
directly or indirectly, their products or wares to any person
or persons not members of the Tile, Mantel and Grate Associa-
tion of California, shall forfeit their membership in the asso-
ciation."
The term "list prices," referred to in the seventh section,
was a list of prices adopted by the association, and when what
are called " unset" tiles were sold by a member to any one not
a member, they were sold at the list prices so adopted, which

were more than fifty per cent higher than when sold to a mem-
ber of the association.
The plaintiffs had established a profitable business and were
competing with all the defendants, who were dealers and en-
gaged in the business of purchasing and selling tiles, grates
and mantels in San Francisco prior to the formation of this
association. The plaintiffs had also before that time been
accustomed to purchase all their tiles from tile manufacturers
in Eastern States, (who were also named as parties defendants
in this action,) and all of those manufacturers subsequently
joined the association. The plaintiffs were not members of
the association and had never been, and had never applied for
membership therein and had never been invited to join the same.
The proof shows that by reason of the formation of this
association the plaintiffs have been injured in their business,
because they were unable to procure tiles from the manufac-
turers at any price, or from the dealers in San Francisco, at
less than the price set forth in the price list mentioned in the
seventh section of the by-laws, supra, which was more than
fifty per cent over the price at which members of the associa-
tion could purchase the same. Before the formation of the as-
sociation the plaintiffs could and did procure their tiles from the
manufacturers at much less cost than it was possible for them
to do from the dealers in San Francisco after its formation.
There was proof on the part of the defendants below that
the condition of carrVinIg $3,00 worth of stock, as mentioned
in the constitution, had not always been enforced, but there
was no averment or proof that the article of the constitution
on that subject had ever been altered or repealed.
The jury rendered a verdict for $500 for the plaintiffs, and,
pursuant to the provisions of the seventh section of the act,
judgment for treble that sum, together with what the trial
court decided to be a reasonable attorney's fee, was entered
for the plaintiffs.
Xllr. William Ml. Pierson for plaintiffs in error:
The association is not obnoxious to the provisions of the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act.

MONTAGUE & CO. v. LOWRY.
193 U. S. Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.
This case can be distinguished from the Trans-Missouri
Case, 166 U. S. 290, and the Joint Traffic Case, 171 U. S. 505.
So far as the transactions between the dealers and the manu-
facturers are concerned, the association fixes no tariff or
prices whatever; and it must be observed generally that the
association itself does no business. It is lawful for a man
to decline to work for another man or class of men, or to do
business with another man or class of men, as he sees fit;
and what is lawful for one man to do in this regard, sev-
eral men may agree to act jointly in doing, and may make
express and simultaneous declaration of their purpose. The
lawfulness of a provision as between dealers and manufactur-
ers, such as is contained in the constitution and by-laws of the
plaintiffs in error, is impliedly recognized in the Hopkins
Case, 171 U. S. 578, and is aptly recognized and approved in
the Anderson, Case, 171 U. S. 604. See also U. S. v. Green-
hut, 51 Fed. Rep. 205; In 9'e Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104;
U. S. v. Nelson, 52 Fed. Rep. 646; Dueber -Mfg. Co. v. Hfow-
ard Co., 55 Fed. Rep. 851; S. C., 14 C. C. A. 14; Gibbs v.
Mc.M ealy, 102 Fed. Rep. 594; Steamship Co. v. ecGregor,
L. R. 23 Q. B. 598; Bo/hn v. Iollis, 54 Minnesota, 223.
Within these authorities and on a view of the constitution
and by-laws of the association in question, it will appear that
the provisions touching transactions between dealers and
manufacturers are not obnoxious to the act of Congress, and
it will appear further that the association in question has
none of the elements of a monopoly. Indeed, the object of the
association is said to be to unite all acceptable dealers and
all American manufacturers.
An association cannot be in restraint of trade when its
doors are open to all in the trade, and it fixes no prices
whatever. The only limitation was to have established homes
with $3,000 worth of stock.
The transactions in unset tiles at list prices are local trans-
actions, intra-state transactions, in no respect taking on the
quality of interstate commerce and being purely local, are
not within the purview of the act. Addyston' Pipe & Steel
