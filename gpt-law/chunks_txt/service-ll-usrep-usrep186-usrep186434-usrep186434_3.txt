Statement of the Case.
There was some insurance on the property when it went into
the hands of the receiver in the suit which was commenced to
wind up the affairs of the company, a portion of which insur-
ance had not been paid for at the time of the appointment of the
receiver, and he thereupon secured directions from the court to
maintain the insurance, and for the purpose of paving the pre-
miums thereon he issued receiver's certificates under the order
of the court. Some but not all of this insurance was still in
force when the receiver turned the property over to Kann at
the time of the deed, July 2, 1894. This insurance expired by
the lapse of time, and afterwards, and while Kann was in pos-
session of the property under his deed from the receiver, he pro-
cured insurance upon his own interest therein and in his own
name. These policies subsequently expired. The Penn Com-
pany when organized, and after it had purchased the property,
took out insurance in its own name upon the same and for its
own benefit exclusively, the Amounts running from $250,000 to
ahout $400,000, and the policies containing this provision:
"This property is subject to a bonded indebtedness of $250,000,
but it is distinctly understood and agreed that this insurance
does not cover the interest of the bondholders." There was no
insurance on the property during the time that the Penn Com-
pany owned it, other than as just stated, but that insurance was
to an amount more than sufficient to secure the bondholders
under the mortgage if the moneys were to be so applied.
While the property was in the hands of Kann and after the
insurance thereon had expired, which had been procured by the
mortgagor company or by its receiver, the mortgagee notified
Kann and required him to keep up or renew or take out other
insurance for .the benefit of the bondholders under the mortgage,
up to the amount thereof, and the same notice and-requirement
were given to and demanded of the mortgagor company. That
company made default and Kann refused to take out any such
insurance, and denied that he was under any obligation so to do.
After Kann sold and conveyed the property to the Penn Com-
pany, the complainant notified that company and required it to
insure in a sum sufficient to afford security for the bondholders
under the mortgage to complainant. The Penn Company re-

fused to so insure and denied any obligation to do so, but, on
the contrary, did insure for its own benefit, the policies of in-
surance containing the provision excluding the interest of the
bondholders under the mortgage.
As stated, the mortgagor company, and also Kann and the
Penn Company, defaulted in the payment of the boupons due
July 1,. 1895, and upon those due January 1 and July 1, 1896,
and thereupon complainant commenced this suit by the filing
of its bill July 8, 1896, asking for the foreclosure of the mort-
gage, and making the mortgagor company, Kann and the Penn
Company defendants. On the same day a motion for a receiver
was noticed on the ground that the mortgage was not good
security for the debt. The mortgagor company made default
and has not appeared in the suit. The other defendants duly
appeared and opposed the motion. It was heard on July 20,
1896. Shortly after the motion had been argued counsel for the
complainant received notice from the judge before whom the
motion had been made, stating that he had concluded to deny
the application for the appointment of a receiver. Upon"a sub-
sequent day, the parties being in court, (no formal order deny-
ing the motion having as yet been -filed,) the counsel for the
complainant said to the court that in the motion for a receiver
it occurred to him that the court had not considered the fact
that this property was without insurance; that there was dan-
ger of fire; that the plaintiff was a trustee without funds, and
that that was a matter that ought to be considered; that the
trustee was entitled to insurance. Counsel upon the other side
denied that they were bound to insure iinder the terms of the
mortgage, and so the dispute continued before the judge, counsel
for the complainant insisting that complainant should have in-
surance and counsel for the other side denying that complainant
was entitled to it at the cost of the defendants, and at the end
the judge remarked that he could not then decide that question,
but intimated to counsel for defendants that if they were bound
to insure they ought to protect the complainant as trustee and
mortgagee. Finally it was suggested that a bond should be
given of the tenor now to be mentioned, but counsel for com-
plainant stated in his evidence upon the subject given in this

case, that he did not wish to be misunderstood, and that it must
be admitted that counsel for the defendants, upon the occasion
mentioned, expressly denied that they were bound to insure for
the benefit of the bondholders; the bond or agreement was
given just as its terms set forth, that if defendants were bound
to insure the insurance would stand for the benefit of the com-
plainant, and if not, the complainant would get nothing. The
bond or agreement was then given by Emanuel Wertheimer
and defendant Kann. It was put in evidence, and Wertheimer
and Kaun therein agreed "that in the event of a loss by fire of
the property described in the said Pennsylvania Plate Glass
Company mortgage, that then there shall be paid out to the said
Farmers' L6an and Trust Company, trustee, in trust for the
holders of valid bonds secured by the said mortgage, a sum
equal to the total amount of such valid bonds, out of the policies
of insurance existing in favor of the Penn Plate Glass Company.
Provided, that it shall have been fin'ally adjudicated that the
Penn Plate Glass Company, the present owner of said property,
is bound or liable by anything contained in the said mortgage,
or the terms of its purchase of the described mortgaged prem-
ises, to keep and maintain insurance for the benefit of the hold-
ers of bonds secured by the said mortgage." This agreement
was given, as counsel for complainant stated, in order to meet
the views of the court, "that if I was entitled to insurance I
should have a bond, and if I was not entitled to insurance, I
would get nothing."
By an interlocutory order, as mentioned in the decree subse-
quently entered, and grounded upon this agreement, the court
appointed Emanuel Wertheimer as receiver for the purpose of
receiving the insurance moneys under the various policies of in-
surance, and, pursuant to such appointment, Wertheimer was
directed to hold, as such receiver, $125,000 of the insurance
moneys so collected, and if it should be finally decreed that the
complainant had an equitable lien upon such insurance moneys,
then the receiver was to pay over to the complainant so much
of that sum as should be necessary to pay and discharge the
$90,000 of the bonds secured by the mortgage, not including
the $160,000 of such bonds belonging to Wertheimer, in regard
