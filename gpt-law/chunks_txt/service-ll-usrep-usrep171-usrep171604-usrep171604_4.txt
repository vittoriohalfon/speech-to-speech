AN DERSON v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.
state commerce which otherwise would not partake of that
character.
There remain in the bill of the complainants the allegations
that the -cattle come from various States and are placed on
sale at these stock yards which form the only available mar-
ket-for many miles around, and that they are sold by the com-
mission merchants and are bought in large numbers by the
defendants who have 'entered into what the complainants
allege to be a contract, combination and conspiracy in re-
straint of trade and commerce among the several States, which
contract, etc., it is alleged is carried out by defendants unlaw-
fully and oppressively refusing to purchase cattle from a com-
mission merchant who sells or purchases cattle from any
speculator (yard trader) who is not a member of the ex-
change; and it is further alleged that by- these means the
traffic in cattle at the Kansas City stock yards is interfered
with, hindered and restrained, and extra expense and loss to
the owner incurred, and that thereby the defendants have
placed an obstruction and embargo on the marketing of cattle
shipped from other States. All these results are alleged to
flow from the agreement among the defendants as contained
in the by-laws of their association, particularly those num-
bered ten, eleven, twelve and thirteen, copies of which are set
forth in the statement of facts herein.
There is no evidence that these defendants have in any
manner other than by the rules above mentioned hindered or
impeded others in shipping, trading or selling their stock, or
that they have in any way interfered with the freedom of
access to the stock yards of any and all other traders and pur-
chasers, or hindered their obtaining the same facilities which
were therein afforded by the stock yards company to the
defendants as members of the exchange, and we think the
evidence does not tend to show that the above results have
flowed from the adoption and enforcement of the rules and
regulations referred to.
In regard to rule 10, the question is whether, without a
violation of the act of Congress, persons who are engaged in
the common business as yard traders of buying cattle at the

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.
Kansas City stock yards, which come from different States,
may agree among themselves that they will form an associa-
tion for the better conduct of their business, and that they
will not transact business with other yard traders who are
not members, nor will they buy cattle from those who also
sell to yard traders who are not members of the association.
It will be remembered that the association does no business
itself. Those who are members thereof compete among them-
selves and with others who are not members, for the purchase
of the cattle, while the association itself has nothing whatever
to do with transportation nor with fixing the prices for which
the cattle may be purchased or thereafter sold. Any yard
trader can become a member of the association upon comply-
ing with its conditions of membership, and may remain such
as long as he comports himself in accordance' with its laws.
A lessening of the amount of the trade is neither the necessary
nor direct effect of its formation, and in truth the amount of
that trade has greatly increased since the association was
formed, and there is not the slightest evidence that the
market prices of cattle have been lowered by reason of its
existence. There is no feature of monopoly in the whole
transaction.
The defendants are engaged in buying what are called
"stockers and feeders;" being cattle not intended for any other
market, and the demand for which is purely local. They have
arrived at their final destination when offered for sale, and
there is free and full competition for their purchase between
all the members of the exchange, as well as between them and
all buyers not members thereof, who are not also yard traders.
With the latter the defendants will not compete, nor will they
buy of the commission men if the latter continue to sell cattle
to such yard traders.
Have the defendants the right to agree to conduct their
own private business in this way ?
Whether there is any violation of the act of Congress by the
adoption and enforcement of the other rules of the association,
above referred to, will be considered hereafter.
It is first contended on the part of the appellants that they

are not engaged in interstate commerce or trade, and that there-
fore their agreement is not a violation of the act. They urge
that the cattle, by being taken from the cars in which they were
transported and placed in the various pens hired by commission
merchants at the cattle yards of Kansas City, and there set up
for sale, have thereby been commingled with the general mass
of other property in the State, and that their interstate com-
mercial character has ceased within the decisions of this court
in Brown v. Houston, 114.U. S. 622, and Piitsburga ndSouth-
ern Coal Co. v. Bates, 156 U. S. 577.
On the other hand, it is answered that the cases cited in-
volved nothing but the general power of the State to tax all
property found within its limits, by virtue of general laws
providing for such taxation, where no tax is levied upon the
article or discrimination made against it by reason of the fact
that it has come from another State, and it is maintained that
the agreement in question acts directly upon the subject of
interstate commerce and adds a restraint to it which is un-
lawful under the provisions of the statute.
In the view we take of this case we are not called upon to
decide whether the defendants are or are not engaged in inter-
state commerce, because if it be conceded they are so en-
gaged, the agreement as evidenced by the by-laws is not one
in restraint of that trade, nor is there any combination to
monopolize or attempt to monopolize such trade within the
meaning of the act.
It has already been stated in the Hopkins case, above men-
tioned, that in order to come within the provisions of the statute
the direct effect of an agreement or combination must be in
restraint of that trade or commerce which is among the sev-
eral States, or with foreign nations. Where the subject-mattei
of the agreement does not directly relate to and act upon and
embrace interstate commerce, and where the undisputed facts
clearly show that the purpose of the agreement was not to
regulate, obstruct or restrain that commerce, but that it was
entered into with the object of properly and fairly regulating
the transaction of the business in which the parties to the
agreement were engaged, such agreement will be upheld as
