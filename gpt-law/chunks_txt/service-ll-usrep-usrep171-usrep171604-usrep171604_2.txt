to packing houses located at Kansas City, Missouri, and
Kansas City in the State of Kansas, and they sell large num-
bers of cattle to the defendants herein.
The bill then alleges that the defendants "have unlawfully
entered into a contract, combination and conspiracy in re-
straint of trade and commerce among the several States and
with foreign nations, in this, to wit, that they have unlawfully
agreed, contracted, combined and conspired to prevent all
other persons than members of the Traders' Live Stock Ex-
change, as aforesaid, from buying and selling cattle upon the
Kansas City market at the Kansas City stock yards as afore-
said; that the commission, firm, person, partnership or corpora-
tion to whom said cattle are consigned at Kansas City, as
aforesaid, is not permitted to and cannot sell or dispose of
said cattle at the Kansas City market as aforesaid to any
buyer or speculator at the Kansas City stock yards unless said
buyer or speculator is a member of the Traders' Live Stock
Exchange, and these defendants (and each of them), unlaw-
fully and oppressively refuse to purchase cattle, or in any
manner negotiate or deal with or buy from any commission
merchant who shall sell or purchase cattle from any speculator
at the said Kansas City stock yards who is not a member of
the said Traders' Live Stock Exchange; that by and through
the unlawful agreement, combination and conspiracy of these
defendants the business and traffic in cattle at the said Kansas
City stock yards is interfered with, hindered and restrained,
thus entailing extra expense and loss to the owner, and plac-
ing an obstruction and embargo on the marketing of cattle
shipped from the States and Territories aforesaid to the
Kansas City stock yards."
It is further alleged that, acting in .pursnance of the unlaw-
ful combination above described, the board of directors of the
exchange have imposed fines upon certain members of the
exchange "who had traded with persons, speculators upon
the markets, who were not members of the said live stock
exchange, and within three months last past have imposed
fines upon members of said live stock exchange who have
traded with commission firms at said Kansas City stock yards

which said commission firms had bought from, and sold cat-
tle to speculators upon said market who were not members
of the said live stock exchange."
It was further stated in the bill that in carrying out the
purposes and aims of this exchange and by the conduct of its
members engaged in this alleged combination, conspiracy and
confederation, they were acting in violation of the laws of
the United States, and particularly in violation of. section 1
of the act of Congress, approved July 2, 1890, c. 647, entitled
"An act to protect trade and. commerce against unlawful
restraints and monopolies," 26 Stat. 209, and in the prosecu-
tion of this unlawful combination they had agreed to hinder
and delay the business of buying and selling cattle at the
market famed and had confederated together in restraint of
trade and commerce between the States, and that the object
of the defendants in organizing the exchange was to prevent
the sale by any. commission merchant at the Kansas City
stock yards of any cattle to any person who might be a buyer
and speculator upon the market who is not a member of the
exchange.
Accompanying this bill were several affidavits of individuals
not members of the exchange, but who were traders or specu-
lators at the stodk yards, and those persons- said that they
were acquainted with the association in question and with the
officers and members, and that they did everything in their
power to prevent other persons who were not. members from
trading at the stock yards, and a number of instances were
given in which the affiants who were not members of the
exchange were endeavoring to do business with commission
merchants and others at the exchange in question, when the
affiants were notified that they could not continue in business
unless they became members of the association, and where
partnerships were engaged in business where one partner was
a member of the association, the partner who was a member
was notified that he could not continue in the partnership
business with the other unless such other also became a mem-
ber; that they had attempted to buy cattle from a great many
commission firms and from their salesmen at these stock yards,

but as soon as they went into the yards where the cattle were
that .were consigned to commission firms and attempted to
purchase them, some of the defendants would appear, call the
salesman aside, and, after having a conversation with such
salesman, the latter would invariably return to affiant and
say that he could not price cattle to the affiant or sell the
same to him, as he had been warned by members of the ex-
change not to c.o so; that the Traders' Live Stock Exchange
would not permit other traders and speculators upon the
market, and that the exchange does not permit commission
firms at -the stock yards to sell cattle consigned to them to
any trader or speculator upon the market who is not a mem-
ber of the exchange, and that commission firms had been
notified by the officers of the stock exchange not to sell to
speculators on the market who were not members of the Live
Stock Exchange, and where commission firms sold cattle to
traders and speculators upon the market who were not mem-
bers of the exchange, the association and members thereof
would boycott the commission firm making such sales, and
refuse to.purchase any cattle from them, and refuse to go into
the lots and look at cattle which had been consigned to them.
Upon the bill and affidavits application was made to the
Circuit Court for the Western Division of the Western Dis-
trict of Missouri for an injunction as prayed for in the bill, in
opposition to which application various affidavits were read on
the part of the defendants, and copies of the articles of asso-
ciation and by-laws of the exchange were attached to the
affidavit of the president of the exchange and read on the
motion.
Among other affidavits was that of the general superintend-
ent of the stock yards company, who said that he had known
the organization, the Traders' Live Stock Exchange, since its
formation, and that it had been a benefit to the live stock
market at Kansas City by furnishing constant buyers for cattle
shipped to the market, no matter how large the receipts for
any one day or series of days might be, and also by raising the
standard of business integrity among its members, because it
required every Tnember to comply with his business promises
