HOPKINS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.
That part of the bill which alleges that no one is permitted
to do business at the cattle market at Kansas City unless he
is a member of this exchange, does not mean that there is
any regulation at the stock yards by which one who is not a
member of the exchange is prevented from doing business,
although ready to pay the established charges of the stock
yards company for its services; but it simply means that by
reason of the members of the exchange refusing to do business
with those who are not members the non-member cannot
obtain the facilities of a market for his cattle such as the
members of the exchange enjoy. It is unnecessary at present
to discuss the question whether there is any illegality in a com-
bination of business men who are members of an exchange
not to do business with those who are not members thereof,
even if the business done were in regard to interstate com-
merce. The first inquiry to be made is as to the character of
the business in which defendants are engaged, and if it be not
interstate commerce, the validity of this agreement not to
transact their business with non-members does not come before
us for decision.
We come, therefore, to the inquiry as to the nature of the
business or occupation that. the defendants are engaged in.
Is it interstate commerce in the sense of that word as it has
been used and understood in the decisions of this court? Or
is it a business which is an aid or facility to commerce, and
which, if it affect interstate commerce at all, does so only
in an indirect and incidental manner?
As set forth in the record, the main facts are that the
defendants have entered into a voluntary association for the
purpose of thereby the better conducting their business, and
that after they entered into such association they still con-
tinued their individual business in full competition with each
other, and that the association itself, as an association, does
no business whatever, but is simply a means by and through
which the individual members who have become thus asso-
ciated are the better enabled to transact their business; to
maintain and uphold a proper way of doing it; and to create
the meanÂ§ for preserving business integrity in the trafisaction

of the business itself. The business of defendants is primarily
and substantially the buying and selling, in their character as
commission merchants, at the stock yards in Kansas City, live
stock which has been consigned to some of them for the pur-
pose of sale, and the rendering of an account of the prc.eeds
arising therefrom. The sale or purchase of live stock as com-
mission merchants at Kansas City is the business done, and
its character is not altered because 'the larger proportion of
the purchases and sales niay be of live stock sent into the
State from other States or from the Territories' Where the
stock came from or where it may uitimately go after a sale or
purchase, procured through the services of one of the defend-
ants at the Kansas City stock yards, is not the substantial
factor in the case. The character of the business of defendants
must, in this case, be determined by the facts occurring at
that city.
If an owner of cattle in Nebraska accompanied them to
Kansas City and there personally employed one of these
defendants to sell the cattle at the stock yards for him on
commission, could it be properly said that such defefdant
in conducting the sale for his principal was engaged in inter-
state commerce? Or that an agreement between himself
and others not.to render such services for less than a certain
sum was a contract in.restiaint of interstate trade or com-
merce? We think not. On the contrary, we regard the
services as collateral to such commerce' and in the nature of
a local aid' or facility provided for the cattle owner towards
the a6complishment of his purpose to sell them; and an
agreement among those who render the services relating to
the terms upon which they will render them is not a contract
in restraint of interstate trade or comnierce.
Is the true character of the transaction altered when the
owner, instead- of coming from Nebraska with his cattle,
sends -them by a common carrier consigned to one of the
defendants at Kansas City with directions to sell the cattle
and render him an account of the proceeds? The services
rendered are the same in both instances, only in one case
they are rendered under a verbal contract made at Kansas

City personally, while in the other they are rendered under
written instructions from the owner given in another State.
This difference in the manner of making the contract for
the services cannot alter the nature of the services themselves.
If the person, under the circumstances stated, who makes a
sale of the cattle 'for the owner by virtue of a personal
employment at Kansas City, is not engaged in interstate
commerce when he makes such sale, we regard it as clear
that he is not so engaged, although he has been employed by
means of a written communication from the owner of the
cattle in another State.
The by-laws of the exchange relate to the business of its
members who are commission merchants at Kansas City,
and some of these by-laws, it is claimed by the Government,
are in violation of the act of Congress, because they are in
restraint of that business which is in truth interstate com-
merce. That one of the by-laws whidh relates to the com-
missions to be charged for selling the various kinds -of stock,
is particularly cited as a violation of the act. In connection
with that by-law it will be well to examine with some detail
the nature of the defendants' business.
It is urged that they are active promoters of the business
of selling cattle upon consignment from their owners in 'other
States, and that in order to secure the business the defendants
send their agents into other States to the owners of the cattle
to solicit the business from them; that the defendants also
lend money to the cattle owners and take back mortgages
upon the cattle as security for the loan; that they make
advances of a portion of the purchase price of the cattle to be
sold, by means of the payment of drafts' drawn upon them by
the shippers of the cattle in another State at the time of the
shipment. All these things, it is said, constitute intercourse
and traffic between the citizens of different States, and hence
the by-law in question operates upon and affects commerce
between the States.
The facts stated do not, in our judgment, in any degree
alter the nature of the services performed by'the defendants,
nor do they render that particular by-law void as in restraint
