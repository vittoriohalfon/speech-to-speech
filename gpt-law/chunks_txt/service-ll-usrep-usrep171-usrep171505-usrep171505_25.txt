UNITED STATES v. JOINT TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION. 577
Opinion of the Court.
The natural, direct and immediate effect of competition
is, however, to lower rates, and to thereby increase the
demand for commodities, the supplying of which increases
commerce, and an agreement, whose first and direct effect is
to prevent this play of competition, restrains instead of pro-
moting trade and commerce. Whether, in the absence of an
agreement as to rates, the consequences described by counsel
will in fact follow as a result of competition, is matter of
very great uncertainty, depending upon many contingencies
and in large degree upon the voluntary action of the man-
agers of the several roads. Railroad companies may and
often do continue in existence and engage in their lawful
traffic at some profit, although they are- competing railroads
and are not acting under any agreement or combination with
their competitors upon the subject of rates. It appears from
the brief of counsel in this case that the agreement in ques-
tion does not embrace all of the lines or systems engaged in
the business of railroad transportation between Chicago and
the Atlantic coast. It cannot be said that destructive com-
petition, or, in other words, war to the death, is bound to
result unless an agreement or combination to avoid it is
entered into between otherwise competing roads.
It is not only possible but probable that good sense and
integrity of purpose would prevail among the managers, and
while making'no agreement and entering into no combination
by which the w.hole railroad interest as herein represented
should act as one combined and consolidated body, the
managers of each road might yet make such reasonable
charges for the business done by it as the facts might justify.
An agreement of the nature of this one which directly and
effectually stifles competition, must be regarded under the
statute as one in restraint of trade,-notwithstanding there are
possibilities that a restraint of trade may also follow competi-
tion that may be indulged in until the weaker roads are com-
pletely destroyed and the survivor thereafter raises rates and
maintains them.
Coming to the conclusion we do, in regard to the vari-
ous questions herein discussed, we think it unnecessary to

HOPKINS v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORAR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 210. Argued February 28, March 1, 1898. -Decided October 24,1 698.
The Kansas City Live Stock Exchange was an unincorporated volunteer
association of men, doiiig 'business at its stock yardA, situated partly in
Kansas City, Missouri, and partly across the line separating Kansas City,
Missouri, from Kansas City, Kansas, The business of its members was to
receive individually consignments of cattle, hogs, and other live stock
from owners of the same, not only in-t he States of Missouri and Kansas,
but also in other States and Territories, and to feed such stock, and to
prepare it for the market, to dispose of the same, to receive the proceeds
thereof from the purchasers, and to pay the owners their proportion of
such proceeds, after deducting charges, expenses and advances. The
members were individually in the habit of soliciting consignments from
the owners of such stock, and of making them advances thereon. The
rules of the association forbade members from buying live stock from a
commission merchant in Kansas City, not a member of the exchange.
They also fixed-the commission for selling such live stock, prohibited the
employment of agents to solicit consignments except upon a stipulated
salary, and forbade the sending of prepaid telegrams or telephone mes-
sages, with information as to the condition of the markets. ,It- was also
provided that no member should transact business with any person vio-
