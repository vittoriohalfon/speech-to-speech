It would follow then, if the sentences quoted from the opinions
in the Freight Association and Joint Traffic cases, which cases
concerned only that which was completely interstate com-
merce, applied to that which was not such commerce, that the
Hopkins case overruled both these cases, although the opinions
in all of the cases were delivered by the same Justice, and no
intimation was suggested of such overruling. It would also
result that, after having overruled those cases in the Hopkins
case, the court, in expressing its opinion through the same
Justice, proceeded in the Addyston Pipe case, which related
only to interstate commerce, to overrule the Hopkins case and
reaffirm the prior cases.
Of course, in my opinion, there is no ground for holding that
the decided cases embody such extreme contradictions or
produce such utter confusion. The cases are all consistent,
if only the elementary distinction upon which they )roceedced
be not obscured, that is, the difference which arises from the
power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce on the one
hand, and its want of authority on the other, to regulate that
which is not interstate commerce. Indeed, the confounding
and treating as one, things which are wholly different, is the
error permeating all the contentions for the Government.
What has been previously said suffices to show the reasons
which control my judgment, and I might well say nothing
more. There were, however, three propositions so earnestly
pressed by the Government at bar upon the theory that they
demonstrate that common ownership of a majority of the
stock of competing railroads is subject to the regulating power
of Congress that I propose to briefly give the reasons which
cause me to conclude that the contentions relied upon are
without merit.
1. This court, it is urged, has frequently declared that the
power of Congress over interstate commerce includes the
authority to regulate the instrumentalities of such commerce,
and the following cases are cited: Railroad Co. v. Fuller, 17
Wall. 560; Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275; Pensacola Telc-

graph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 96 U. S. 1; Gloucester
Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania,1 14 U. S. 196. To these cases might
be added many others, including some of those which have
been previously referred to by me. The argument now made
is, as the power extends to instrumentalities, and railroads are
such instrumentalities, therefore the acquisition and ownership
of railroads, by persons or corporations, is commerce and sub-
ject to the power of Congress to regulate. But this involves a
non sequitur, and a confusion of thought arising from again
confounding as one, things which are wholly different. True,
the instrumentalities of interstate commerce are subject to the
power to regulate commerce, and therefore such instrumen-
talities when employed in interstate commerce may be regu-
lated by Congress as to their use in such commerce. But this
is entirely distinct from the power to regulate the acquisition
and ownership of such instrumentalities, and the many forms
of contracts from which such ownership may arise. The same
distinction exists between the two which obtains between the
power of Congress to regulate the movement of property in the
channels of interstate commerce and its want of authority to
regulate the acquisition and ownership of the same property.
This difference was pointed out in the cases which have beefi
referred to, and the distinction between the two has been from
the beginning the dividing line, demarking the power of the
national government on the one hand and of the States on the
other. All the rights of ownership in railroads belonging to
corporations organized under state law, the power to acquire
the same, to mortgage, to foreclose mortgages, to lease, and the
contract relations concerning them, have from the foundation
had their sanction in the legislation of the several States.
One may search in vain in the acts of Congress for any legisla-
tion even suggesting that the power over these subjects was
deemed to be in Congress. On the contrary, the legislation
of Congress concerning the instrumentalities of railroads under
the interstate commerce power clearly refutes the contention,
since that legislation relates only to such instrumentalities

during their actual use in interstate commerce and not other-
wise. How, consistently with the proposition, can the great
number of cases be explained which in both the Federal and
state courts have dealt with the ownership of railroads and
their instrumentalities by foreclosure and otherwise, under
the assumption that the rights of the parties were controlled
by state laws governing the subject? And here again it would
follow, if the proposition was adopted, that all the vast body
of state legislation on the subject would be void from the
beginning and the enormous sum of property rights depending
upon such legislation would be impaired and lost, since if the
subject were within the power of Congress it was one requiring
a uniform regulation, and therefore the inaction of Congress
would signify an entire want of power in the States over the
subjects.
2. The court, it is urged, has in a number of cases declared
that the several States were without power to directly burden
interstate commerce. The acquiring and ownership by one
person or corporation of a majority of the stock in competing
railroads engaged in interstate commerce, it is argued, being
a direct burden, therefore power to regulate the subject is in
Congress and not in the States. Undoubtedly not only in the
decisions referred to but in many others, including most of
those which have been by me quoted, the absolute want of
power in the States to legislate concerning interstate commerce
or to burden it directly has been declared, and the doctrine in
its fullest scope is too elementary to require citation of author-
ity. But to decide this case upon the assumption that the
acquisition and ownership of stock in competing railroads
engaged in interstate commerce is a regulation of commerce,
or, what is the same thing, a direct burden on it, would be but
to assume the question arising for decision.
Where an authority is exerted by a State which is within its
power, and that authority as exercised does not touch interstate
commerce or its instrumentalities, and can only have an effect
upon such commerce by reason of the reflex and remote results
