UNITED STATES v. FREIGHT ASSOCIATION. 311
Opinion of the Court.
traffic would be so severe as to cause great losses to each
defendant and possibly ruin the companies represented in the
agreement. Such a result, it is claimed, is avoided by reason
of the agreement. Upon the existence, therefore, of this or
some similar agreement directly depends (as is alleged) the pros-
perity, if not the life, of each company. It must follow that
an amount much more than a thousand dollars is involved
in the maintenance of the agreement or in the right to main-
tain it or something like it. These facts, appearing in the
record and the stipulation, show that the right involved is a
right which is of the requisite pecuniary value. A reduction
of the rates by only the fractional part of one per centum
would, in the aggregate, amount to over a thousand dollars in
a very few days. This is sufficient to give the court jurisdic-
tion on appeal. South Carolina v. Seymour, 153 U. S. 353,
357. There is directly involved in this suit the validity and
the life of this agreement, or one similar to it. Out of this
agreement directly springs the ability as well as the right to
maintain these rates, and each company is interested in main-
taining the validity of the agreement to the same extent as
all the others. As against the agreement the Government
represents the interest of the public, and thus the parties stand
opposed to each other - the one in favor of dissolving and the
other of maintaining the agreement.
Unlike the case of Gibson v. Shufeldt, 122 U. S. 27, and the
cases therein cited in the opinion of the court delivered by
Mr. Justice Gray, the defendants here are jointly interested
in the question, and it is not the case of a fund amounting to
more than the requisite sum which is to be paid to different
parties in sums less than the jurisdictional amount.
For the reasons above stated, we think the jurisdictional
fact in regard to each defendant appears plainly and neces-
sarily from the record and the stipulation, and that the duty
is thus laid upon this court to entertain the appeal.
Coming to the merits of the suit, there are two important
questions which demand our examination. They are, first,
whether the above-cited act of Congress (called herein the
Trust Act) applies to and covers common carriers by railroad;

and, if so, second, does the agreement set forth in the bill
violate any provision of that act?
As to the first question :
The language of the act includes every contract, combina-
tion in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States or
with foreign nations. So far as the very terms of the statute
go, they apply to any contract of the nature described. A
contract therefore that is in restraint of trade or commerce is
by the strict language of the act prohibited even though such
contract is entered into between competing common carriers
by railroad, and only for the purposes of thereby affecting
traffic rates for the transportation of persons and property.
If such an agreement restrain trade or commerce, it is pro-
hibited by the statute, unless it can be said that an agree-
ment, no matter what its terms, relating only to transportation
cannot restrain trade or commerce. We see no escape from
the conclusion that if any agreement of such a nature does
restrain it, the agreement is condemned by this act. It can-
not be denied that those who are engaged in the transpor-
tation of persons or property from one State to another are
engaged in interstate commerce, and it would seem to follow
that if such persons enter into agreements between themselves
in regard to the compensation to be secured from the owners
of the articles transported, such agreement would at least
relate to the business of commerce, and might more or less
restrain it. The point urged on the defendants' part is that
the statute was not really intended to reach that kind of an
agreement relating only to traffic rates entered into by com-
peting common carriers by railroad; that it was intended to
reach only those who were engaged in the manufacture or
sale of articles of commerce, and who by means of trusts, com-
binations and conspiracies were engaged in affecting the
supply or the price or the place of manufacture of such
articles. The terms of the act do not bear out such construc-
tion. Railroad companies are instruments of commerce, and
their business is commerce itself. State Freight Tax case, 15
Wall. 232, 275; Telegraph Co. v. Texas, 105 U. S. 460, 464.

UNITED STATES v. FREIGHT ASSOCIATION. 313
Opinion of the Court.
An act which prohibits the making of every contract, etc., in
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States,
would seem to cover by such language a contract between
competing railroads, and relating to traffic rates for.the trans-
portation of articles of commerce between the States, pro-
vided such contract by its direct effect produces a restraint
of trade or commerce. What amounts to a reptraint within
the meaning of the act if thus construed need not now be
discussed.
We have held that the Trust Act did not apply to a com-
pany engaged in one State in the refining of sugar under the
circumstances detailed in the case of United States v. E. C.
Knight Company, 156 U. S. 1, because the refining of sugar
under those circumstances bore no distinct relation to com-
merce between the States or with foreign nations. To ex-
clude agreements as to rates by competing railroads for the
transportation of articles of commerce between the States
would leave little for the act to take effect upon.
Nor do we think that because the sixth section does not
forfeit the property of the railroad company when merely
engaged in the transportation of property owned under and
which was the subject of a contract or combination men-
tioned in the first section, any ground is shown for holding
the rest of the act inapplicable to carriers by. railroad. It
is not perceived why, if the rest of the act were intended
to apply to such a carrier, the sixth section ought necessarily
to have provided for the seizure and condemnation of the
locomotives and cars of the carrier engaged in the trans-
portation between the States of those articles of commerce
owned as stated in that sixth section. There is some justice
and propriety in forfeiting those articles, but we see none in
forfeiting the locomotives or cars of the carrier simply be-
cause such carrier was transporting articles as described from
one State to another, even though the carrier knew that they
had been manufactured or sold under a contract or combina-
tion in violation of the act. In the case of a simple trans-
portation of such articles the carrier would be guilty of no
violation of any of the provisions of the act. Why, there-
