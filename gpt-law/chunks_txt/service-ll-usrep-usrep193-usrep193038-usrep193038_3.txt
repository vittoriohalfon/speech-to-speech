ment, the transactions in unset tiles to be along the line of
interstate commerce,-they are so trifling, incidental and
remote in their bearing upon interstate trade and commerce
as to be what mathematicians call negligible quantities which
may be left out of consideration without impairing the general
result. Trans-.Missoui'i case, the Joint Trafio case, and H}o-

The attorney fee allowed was excessive. Plaintiffs below
asked for $10,000 damages and were only allowed $500 and
the fee is out of proportion.
Xr. J. C. Campbell for defendant in error:
The Tile, Mantel and Grate Association of California is a
combination declared to be illegal by the act of July 2, 1890,
for it is in restraint of trade or commerce among the several
States, and was formed to and does monopolize such trade or
commerce. United States v. Freiglt Association, 166 U. S.

MR. JUSTIEn PEcKrrAm, after making the foregoing state-
ment, delivered the opinion of the court.
The question raised by the plaintiffs in error in this case is,
whether this association, described in the foregoing statement
of facts, constituted or amounted to an agreement or combi-
nation in restraint of trade within the meaning of the so-called
Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890 ?
The result of the agreement when carried out was to pre-
vent the dealer in tiles in San Francisco, who was not a
member of the association, from purchasing or procuring the
same upon any terms from any of the manufacturers who were
such members, and all of those manufacturers who had been
accustomed to sell to the plaintiffs were members. The non-

member dealer was also prevented by the agreement from
buying tiles of a dealer in San Francisco who was a member,
excepting at a greatly enhanced price over what he would
have paid to the manufacturers or to any San Francisco dealer
who was a member, if he, the purchaser, were also a meniber
of the association. The agreement, therefore, restrained trade,
for it narrowed the market for the sale of tiles in California
from the manufacturers and dealers therein in other States, so
that they could only be sold to the members of the associa-
tion, and it enhanced prices to the non-member as already
stated.
The plaintiffs endeavored in vain to procure tiles for the
purposes of their business from these tile manufacturers, but
the latter refused to deal with them because plaintiffs were
not members of the association. It is not the simple case of
manufacturers of an article of commerce between the several
States refusing to sell to certain other persons. The agree-
ment is between manufacturers and dealers belonging to an
association in which the dealers agree not to purchase from
manufacturers not members of the association, and not to sell
unset tiles to any one not a member of the association for less
than list prices, which are more than fifty per cent higher
than the prices would be to those who were members, while
the manufacturers who became members agreed not to sell to
any one not a member, and in case of a violation of the agree-
ment they were subject to forfeiting their membership. By
reason of this agreement, therefore, the market for tiles is, as
we have said, not only narrowed but the prices charged by
the San Francisco dealers for the unset tiles to those not
members of the association are more than doubled. It is
urged that the sale of unset tiles, provided for in the seventh
section of the by-laws, is a transaction wholly within the State
of California and is not in any event a violation of the act of
Congress which applies only to commerce between the States.
The provision as to this sale is but a part of the agreement,
and it is so united with the rest as to be incapable of separa-
tion without at the same time altering the general purpose of
the agreement. The whole agreement is to be construed as

one piece, in which the manufacturers are parties as well as
the San Francisco dealers, and the refusal to sell on the part
of the manufacturers is connected with and a part of the
scheme which includes the enhancement of the price of the
unset tiles by the San Francisco dealers. The whole thing is
so bound together that when looked at as a whole the sale of
unset tiles ceases to be a mere transaction in the State of Cal-
ifornia, and becomes part of a purpose which, when carried
out, amounts to and is a contract or combination in restraint
of interstate trade or commerce.
Again, it is contended the sale of unset tiles is so small in
San Francisco as to be a negligible quantity ; that it does not
amount to one per cent of the business of the dealers in tiles in
that city. The amount of trade in the coinmoditly is not very
material, but even though such dealing heretofore has been
small, it would probably largely increase when those who
formerly purchased tiles from the manufacturers are shut out
by reason of the association and their non-membership there-
in from purchasing their tiles from those manufacturers, and
are compelled to purchase them from the San Francisco deal-
ers. Either the extent of the trade in unset tiles would in-
crease between the members of the association and outsiders,
or else the latter would have to go out of business, because
unable to longer compete with their rivals who were mem-
bers. In either event, the combination, if carried out, di-
rectly effects a restraint of interstate commerce.
It is also contended that, as the expressed object of the as-
sociation was to unite therein all the dealers in San Francisco
and vicinity, the plaintiffs had nothing more to do than join
the association, pay their fees and dues and become like one
of the other members. It was not., however, a matter of
course to permit any dealer to join. The constitution only
provided for "all acceptable dealers" joining the associa-
tion. As plaintiffs were not invited to be among its founders,
it would look as if they were not regarded as acceptable.
However that may be, they never subsequently to its forma-
tion applied for admission. It is plain that the question of
their admission, if they had so applied, was one to be arbi-
