ment relates to the manner in which competitors shall con-
duct their business. If one competing concern buys the plant
or business of its competitor, competition is not thereby di-
rectly restrained. The restraint in such case, if any, is merely
an incident to the ownership of property, and the fact that
there may be such a restraint does not forbid the acquiring of
such ownership. By unity of interest output is not necessarily
limited, prices are not necessarily increased. On the contrary,
the public may be benefited, prices may be less by reason of
greatly increased volume of business and less cost per unit of
production.
Third. The Anti-Trust Act is a penal statute and, as con-
strued by the court below, it makes unity of ownership of a
majority of the shares of competing corporations engaged in
interstate trade, no matter how such ownership is acquired,
criminal, because such ownership gives power to commit crime.
It is conceded that such ownership, so far as it may control
the policy of the corporations, can be exercised for a lawful
purpose, for building up trade, increasing competition and re-
ducing prices.
It is not claimed or pretended that in the case under review
trade has been restrained, yet the court below held that unity
of ownership of a majority of the-stock of the defendant rail-
way companies was unlawful, and, therefore, criminal, because
such ownership has necessarily caused the doing of something
that has not been done; has necessarily restrained trade,
though trade has not been restrained.
Stated in another way, the court below decided that owner-
ship by the Securities Company of a majority of stock of the
defendant railway companies regulates the commerce of the
companies, and though such commerce- has in fact been so reg-
ulated as to build up trade, increase competition and reduce
prices, in law it has necessarily been so regulated as to restrain
trade, suppress competition and increase prices because through
unity of ownership motive to compete* has been destroyed.

Fourth. Trade has not been restrained through the exercise
of the voting power of these stocks. The ruling that ti'ade
has been restrained, is contrary to the facts, and charges the
individuals engaged in this transaction with a crime, that has
not been committed nor intended.
When this suit was begun, the shares of the Northern Se-
curities Company were held by over eighteen hundred separate
owners who had purchased them in good faith, in the usual
course of business. The shareholders of the defendant rail-
way companies, who were instrumental in organizing the Se-
curities Company, have never owned to exceed one-third of its
stock. The control of the Securities Company, so far as stock
ownership can control it through the election of a board of
directors, is not in the eight Great Northern shareholders who
were concerned in the organization of the company, but in the
seventeen hundred and ninety shareholders owners of more
than two-thirds of its stock. The combination of which the
court convicted the eight individual defendants, was not one
by which they were to acquire control over the two railway
companies, for themselves, but one through which such con-
trol would necessarily be conferred upon the seventeen hun-
dred and ninety other stockholders of the Securities Company.
The ruling of the court that the possession of the voting
power of a majority of the shares of the defendant railway
companies by the Securities Company, necessarily restrains
trade through suppressing competition, finds no support in
facts. The boards of directors of both railway companies
may be elected by the Securities Company. The executive
officers of the two companies will be elected by these boards,
and the ruling of the courts rests upon the proposition, that
such boards and officers will be influenced, persuaded or coerced
in such way, that they will lack their former incentive to com-
pete for traffic, to obtain it from each other, and to underbidl
each other for the purpose of getting it; that they will enter

into contracts or in some way through concert of action, main-
tain higher rates than ought to be maintained; in other words,
that they will charge unreasonable rates, will not provide
adequate facilities, nor extend construction of lines.
The Northern Securities Company has no power or motive
to restrain trade which any single owner of a majority of the
shares of defendant railway companies would not have, and
which the individual owners of the shares did not have, by law-
ful conference and concert of action, before they transferred
their shares to it.
The defendant railway companies were hampered and placed
at disadvantage with other transcontinental railways, as well
as with ocean competitors by the want of sufficient direct
connection with traffic centers offering the best markets for
the products of the country along their lines, and with places
of production and distribution from which their traffic must
be supplied. Through the Burlington purchase they acquired
permanent access to markets and sources of supply, instead
of a temporary one resting upon joint rates subject to change
at any time without regard to their interest. Having made
the purchase and assumed the resulting joint and several
obligations, it became a matter of the highest importance
to each company that the burdens should be equally borne
and the advantages equally shared. Through placing the
ownership of a majority of the shares of both companies in the
hands of a single owner, the benefits of the Burlington purchase
became better assured than would be the case if the shares were
held in many hands, and liable at any time to be sold to an
interest adverse to the building up of the business of the de-
fendant railway companies and the country which their lines
traverse.
It has not been shown that the power of the defendant rail-
way companies to restrain competition can affect more than
three or four per cent of their interstate traffic, or that it has
affected or can affect construction or extension of their lines,
or the amount or quality of their equipment. Through their
