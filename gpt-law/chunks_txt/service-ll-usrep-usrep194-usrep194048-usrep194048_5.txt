Opinion of the Court. 194 TT. S.
ern Pacific Railway Company each owned or controlled and
maintained a system of railways connecting the Great Lakes
and the Pacific Ocean, their main roads constituting, sub-
stantially, parallel and competing lines;
That pursuant to an agreement between the defendant Hill
and other stockholders of the Great Northern Railway Com-
pany (representing a controlling interest in the stock of that
company) and J. Pierpont Morgan and other stockholders of
the Northern Pacific Railway Company (representing a con-
trolling interest in the stock of that company) the Northern
Securities Company was incorporated solely as an instru-
mentality through which the stock, property and franchises
of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies
should be consolidated in effect, if not in form, and the manage-
ment and control of their business affairs, respectively, in-
cluding the fixing of rates and charges for the transportation
of passengers and freight over any and all the lines of railway
of each of those companies, as well within as without the State,
be vested in and controlled by the Securities Company, and
all competition in freight and passenger traffic between the
two systems of railway, within and without the State, to be
suppressed and removed; that by means of such arrangement
it was sought and intended to ignore, evade and violate the
laws of the State prohibiting as well the consolidation of the
stock, property or' franchise of parallel or competing lines of
railway therein, and the control or management thereof, as all
combinations in restraint of trade or commerce within the
State, and between the people of Minnesota and the people of
other States and countries; and, that if the Securities Company
was allowed to hold and control the stocks of the constituent
railway companies and to carry out the purpose and object of
its incorporators, as well as its own, "full faith and credit will
not be given to the public acts of this complainant and it will
be deprived of a further right guaranteed to it by the Constitu-
tion of the United States;"
That the said scheme had been consummated, and said two

railway systems were now under the absolute management and
control of the Securities Company, and "by reason thereof all
competition between said lines has been destroyed and a
monopoly in railway traffic in Minnesota (as well as without
said State) has been created, to the great and permanent and
irreparable damage of the State of Minnesota, and to the
people thereof, and in violation of its laws, and of the laws of
the United States in such case made and provided, viz: The
act, of Congress approved July 2, 1890, entitled 'An act to
protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and
monopolies;' " and
That the carrying out the above agreements and plan of
consolidation and monopoly, and in eVery step taken to con-
sumnmate it, the officers and directors of each of said railway
companies were severally fully advised and consented thereto,
and, unless restrained by this court, the Securities Company
would continue to manage and control the business and affairs
of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway com-
panies, and to suppress all competition between them for
freight and passenger traffic, as well as to monopolize rail-
way traffic in that State, to the irreparable damage of the
State and the people thereof.
The substantial relief asked was a decree declaring, among
other things, the illeged agreement and combination to be
unlawful, and all acts done and to be done in pursuance thereof
contrary to and in violation of the laws of Minnesota and of
the United States; prohibiting the Securities Company, its
agents and officers, from acquiring, receiving, holding, voting
or in any manner acting as the owner of any of the shares of
the capital stock of either the Northern Pacific or the Great
Northern Railway Company, or from exercising any manage-
ment, direction or control over the constituent companies; and
enjoining those railway companies from recognizing or ac-
cepting the Northern Securities Company as the holder or
owner of any shares of the capital stock of either of 'those
companies, or from effecting any combination or agreement

that would disturb their independent integrity, management
and control, respectively, or that would directly or indirectly
destroy free and unlimited competition between them by in-
terchange of traffic, poolings of earnings, division of property
or otherwise.
The Securities Company, appearing specially for that pur-
pose, filed its petition for the removal of the case into the
Circuit Court of the United States upon the ground that the
suit was of a. civil nature, in equity, involved, exclusive of
costs, the sum of two thousand dollars, and was one arising
under the Constitution and laws of the United States.
The state court a)proved the required statutory bond for
removal, and made an order, reciting that the case was re-
moved to the Federal court.
The Northern Securities Cornpany, appearing specially for
that purpose, gave notice of a motion to have the service of
summons upon it vacated. Notice was also given of a like
motion as to the service of summons upon defendant Hill in
his capacity as President of that company. Subsequently,
the company, and defendant Hill as its President, gave notice
that the above notices were withdrawn, and they accordingly
entered their appearance in the cause.
At a later date the defendants severally answered, and the
State filed its replication to each answer. Proofs were taken,
and the cause having been heard, the bill was dismissed upon
the merits. 123 Fed. Rep. 692.
After the cause was argued here the parties were invited to
submit briefs upon the question whether the Circuit Court of
the United States could take Cognizan~e of the. case upon
removal from the state court. From the briefs filed in re-
sponse tW that invitation it appeared that both sides deemed
the case a removable one and insist 'that this court should
consider the merits as disclosed by the pleadings and evidence.
But consent of -parties can never confer jurisdiction upon a
Federal court. If the record does not affirmatively show
jurisdiction in the Circuit Court, we must, upon our own
