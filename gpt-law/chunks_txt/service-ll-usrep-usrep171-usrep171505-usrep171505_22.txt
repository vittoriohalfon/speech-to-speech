and the sale of a good will of a business with an accompany-
ing agreement not to engage in a similar business was instanced
in the Trans-.Misouric ase as a contract not within the mean-
ing of the act ; and it was said- that such a contract was col-
lateral to the main contract of sale and was entered into for
the purpose of enhancing the price at which the vendor sells
his business. The instances cited by counsel have in our judg-
ment-little or no bearing upon the question under considera-
tion. In Hopkins v. United States, decided at this term, -ost,
578, we say that the statute applies only to those contracts
..whose direct and immediate effect is a restraint upon inter-
state commerce, and that to treat the act as condemning all
agreements under which, as a result, the cost of conducting
an interstate commercial business may be increased, would
enlarge the application of the act far beyond the fair meaning
of the language used. The effect upon interstate commerce
must not be indirect or incidental only. An agreement en-
tered into for the purpose of promoting the legitimate business
of an individual or corporation, with no purpose to thereby
affect or restrain interstate commerce, and which does not
directly restrain such commerce, is not, as we think, covered
by the act, although the agreement may indirectly and re-
motely affect that commerce. We also repeat what is said in
the case above cited, that "the act of Congress must have a
reasonable construction, or else there would scarcely be an
agreement or contract among business men that could not be
said to have, indirectly or remotely, some bearing upon inter-
state commerce, and possibly to restrain it." To suppose, as
is assumed by counsel, that the effect of the decision in the
Trans-Missowric ase is to render illegal most business contracts
or combinations, however indispensable and necessary they
may be, because, as they assert, they all restrain trade in
some remote and indirect degree, is to make a most violent
assumption and one not called for or justified by the decision
mentioned, or by any other decision of this court.
The question really before us is whether Congress, in the
exercise of its right to regulate commerce among the several
States, or otherwise, has the power to prohibit, as in restraint

Opinion of the Court.
-of interstate commerce, a contract or combination between
competing railroad corporations entered into and formed for
the purpose of establishing and maintaining interstate rates
and fares for the transportation of freight and passengers on
any of the railroads parties to the contract -or combination,
even though the rates and fares thus established are reason-
able. Such an agreement directly affects and of course is
intended to affect the cost of transportation of commodities,
and commerce consists, among other things, of the transpor-
tation of commodities, and if such transportation be between
States it is interstate commerce. The agreement affects inter-
state commerce by destroying competition and by maintaining
rates above what competition might produce.
If it did not do that, its existence would be useless, and it
would soon lie rescinded or abandoned. Its acknowledged
purpose is to maintain rates, and if executed, it does so. It
must be remembered, however, that the act does not prohibit
any railroad company from charging reasonable rates. If in
the absence of any contract or combination among the rail-
road companies the rates and fares would be. less than they
are under such contract or combination, that is not by reason
-of any provision of the act which itself lowers rates, but only
because the railroad companies would, as it is urged, volun-
tarily and at once inaugurate a war of competition among them-
selves, and thereby themselves reduce their rates and fares.
Has not Congress with regard to interstate commerce and
in the course of regulating it, in the case of railroad corpora-
tions, the power to say that no contract or combination shall
be legal which shall restrain trade and commerce by shutting
out the operation of the general law of competition? We
think it has.
As counsel for the Traffic Association has truly said, the
ordinary highways on. land have generally been established
and maintained by the public. When the matter of the
building of railroads as highways arose, a question was pre-
sented whether the State should itself build them or permit
others to do it. The State did not build them, and as their
.building required, among other things, the appropriation of

land, private individuals could not enforce such appropriatiom
without a grant from the State.
The building and operation of a railroad thus required a
public franchise. The State would have had no power to.
grant the right of appropriation unless the use to which the
land was to be put was a public one. Taking land for rail-
road purposes is a taking for a public purpose, and the fact
that it is taken for a public purpose is the sole justification for
taking it at all. The business of a railroad carrier is of a
public nature, and in performing it the carrier is also per-
forming to a certain. extent a function of government which,
as counsel observed, requires them to perform the service
upon equal terms to all. This public service, that of trans-
portation of passengers and freight, is- a paft of trade and
commerce, and when. transported between States such com-
merce becomes what is described as interstate, and comes,
to a certain extent, under the jurisdiction of Congress by vir-
tue of its power to regulate commerce among the several
States.
Where the grantees of this public franchise are competing
railroad companies for interstate commerce, we think Con-
gress is competent to forbid any agreement or combination
among them by means of which competition is to be smothered.
Although the franchise when granted by the State becomes
by the grant the property of the grantee, yet there are soihe
regulations respecting the exercise of such grants which Con-
gress may make under its power to regulate commerce among
the several States. This will be conceded by all, the only
question being as to the extent of the power.
We think it extends at least to the prohibition of contracts
relating to interstate commerce, which would extinguish all
competition between otherwise competing railroad corpora-
tions, and which would in that way restrain interstate trade
or commerce. We do not think, when the grantees of this
public franchise are competing railroads seeking the busi-
ness of transportation of men and goods from'-one State to
another, that ordinary freedom of contract in the use and
management of their property requires the right to combine
