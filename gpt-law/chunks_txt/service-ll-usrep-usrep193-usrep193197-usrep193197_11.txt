tended combination or conspiracy alleged in subdivision VIII
of the petition, or as an instrumentality to effect the purposes
thereof, and it denies that by reason of the matters or any of
them in the petition alleged a virtual or any consolidation of
said defendant railway companies or their business has been
effected or intended; and it denies any conspiracy or combina-
tion in restraint of trade or commerce among the States, or with
foreign nations, or that the defendants or any of them are
attempting or intending to monopolize or restrain any such
trade or commerce.
IX. It denies each and every allegation in subdivision IX
of the petition.
X. This defendant says that it does not know and cannot set
forth how much additional stock of either defendant railway
company it is likely to acquire, since each acquisition of shares
by it depends, among other contingencies, on the willingness of
the holders of the said stock to sell it upon terms which this
defendant may be willing to accept.
XI. This defendant says it has bought and paid for and has
caused to be transferred to it upon the records of the Great
Northern Company, in accordance with the by-laws of that
company, about five-twelfths (A) of the shares of that com--
pany's stock; and has also negotiated for, but has not yet
caused to be presented to the Great Northern Company for
transfer upon its records, other shares of the stock of that com-
pany aggregating about four-twelfths (TA) of the total amount
of its stock, but has not acquired a right to vote as stockholder
of the Great Northern Company on stock not so transferred.
This defendant, in acquiring shares of the Great Northern Com-
pany and of the Northern Pacific Company, dealt solely with
the separate owners of the said shares in their respective indi-
vidual capacities. It has no knowledge of any agreement,
promise, or understanding between any of the holders of said
stock concerning the sale thereof to it, and it denies that any
such agreement, promise, or understanding was ever made.
All the sales and transfers of the said stock to this defendant

were absolute and without any reservation of any right
or interest in any share thereof to the seller or to any other
person.
This defendant has not paid for all the stock of the Great,
Northern Company and of the Northern Pacific Company
acquired by it in shares of its own stock, but, on the contrary,
has expended upward of forty million dollars ($40,000,000)
cash in the making of such purchases. Every share of the
Great Northern Company and the Northern Pacific Company
acquired by this defendant has been, and so long as it, remains
the property of this defendant will continue to be, held and
owned by it in its own right, and not under any agreement,
promise, or understanding on its part, or on the part of its stock-
holders or officers, that the same shall be held, owned, or kept
by it for any period of time whatever, or under any agreement
that in any manner restricts its right and power immediately to
sell or otherwise dispose of the same, or that restricts or con-
trols to any extent any use of the same, which might lawfully
be exercised by any other owner of said stocks. There has
been and is no agreement, promise, or understanding between
any of the holders of said stock so acquired by this defen(la,
or between any of them and any other person or corporation,
that any of said shares should at any time be held, used, or
voted by this defendant for the purpose of combining or con-
solidating or placing under one common management or control
the railways of the Great Northern Company and of the North-
ern Pacific Company, or the business thereof, or for the purpose
of monopolizing or restraining traffic or competition between
the said railways. Many stockholders of the said companies
have not sold, and may never sell, their shares to this defend-
ant; and the said railway companies have not nor have any of
the directors of either of them, by any act, formal or informal,
or by suggestion, ever solicited any of their respective share-
holders to sell their shares to this defendant. This defendant
was organized in good faith, and it denies all the allegations in
subdivision XI of the petition.

XII. This defendant denies each and every allegation in
subdivision XII of the petition.
XIII. This defendant denies each and every allegation in
subdivision XIII of the petition.
SECOND.
Further answering the petition, this defendant, upon informa-
tion and belief, says that the facts as to the purchase of the
shares of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Com-
pany (hereinafter called the Burlington Company) and the
planning and forming of this defendant and the motives,
intentions, and purposes of the persons and corporations con-
cerned in these enterprises, or either of them, were not as
erroneously stated in the petition, but were and are as follows:
I. When projecting the line of the Great Northern Company
to the Pacific coast, that company and its directors contem-
plated the necessity of creating for the line not merely State and
interstate, but an international commerce. Nearly all the
country traversed or reached by the line was then but sparsely
settled or not settled at all. It was principally agricultural,
grazing, or timber land, with mineral deposits in the mountain
ranges believed to be large and valuable, but not developed or
explored. Whatever commodities the region might furnish for
carriage would be raw material, of great weight and bulk in
proportion to its value, which would not bear transportation
to market except at a low mileage rate, such as could be made
possible only by every practical reduction in the cost of trans-
portation. The available market for all such products was far
from the places of production.
In Washington and Oregon are the largest and finest bodies
of standing timber in the United States, the best market for
which is in the prairie States of the Mississippi Valley east of
the Rocky Mountains; but the lumber and shingles from the
Pacific coast would not bear the cost of transportation to those
States if the cars carrying them had to be hauled back empty,
or nearly so, for a distance of from 1,500 to 2,000 miles. And
