not within the statute, where it can be seen that the character
and terms of the agreement are well calculated to attain the
purpose for which it was formed, and where the effect of its
formation and enforcement upon interstate trade or commerce
is in any event but indirect and incidental, and not its purpose
or object. As is said in Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465,.
473: "There are many cases, however, where the acknowl-
edged powers of a State may be exerted and applied in such a
manner as to affect foreign or interstate commerce without
being intended to operate as comm.rcial regulations." The
same. is true as to certain kinds of agreements entered into
between persons engaged in the same business for the direct
and bonafide purpose of properly and reasonably regulating
the conduct of their business among themselves and with the
public. If an agreement of that nature,, while apt and proper
for the purpose thus intended, should possibly, though only
indirectly an~d unintentionally, affect interstate trade or com-
merce, in that event we think the agreement would be good.
Otherwise, there is scarcely any agreement among men which
has interstate or foreign commerce for its subject that may not
remotely be said to, in some obscure way, affect that commerce
and to be therefore void. We think, within the plain and
obvious construction to be placed upon the act, and following
the rules in this regard already laid down in the cases hereto-
fore decided in this court, we must hold the agreement under
consideration in this suit to be valid.
From very early times it has been the custom for men
engaged in the occupation of buying and selling articles of a
similar nature at any particular place to associate themselves
together. The object of the association .has in many cases
been to provide for thb ready transaction of the business of
the associates by obtaining a general headquarters for its
conduct, and thus to ensure a quick and certain market for
the sale or purchase of the article dealt in. Another purpose
has been to provide a standard of business integrity among
the members by adopting rules for just and fair dealing
among them and enforcing the same by penalties for their
violation. The agreements have been voluntary, and the

penalties have been enforced under the supervision and by
members of the association. The preamble adopted by the
association in this case shows the ostensible purpose of its
formation. It was not formed for pecuniary profits, and a
careful perusal of the whole agreement fails, as we think, to
show that its purpose was other than as stated in the pre-
amble. In other words, we think that the rules adopted do
not contradict the expressed purpose of the preamble, and
that the result naturally to be expected from an enforcement
of the rules would not directly, if at all, affect interstate trade
or commerce. The agreement now under discussion differs
radically from those of United .tatem v. Jellico Mountain Coal
& Coke Co., 46 Fed. Rep. 432; Uhited States v. Coal Dealers
Association of California,8 5 Fed. Rep. 252, and United States
v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 85 Fed. Rep. 271. The agree-
ment in all of these cases provided for fixing the prices of the
articles dealt in by the different companies, being in one case
iron pipe for gas, water, sewer and other purposes, and coal
in the other two cases. If it were conceded that these cases
were well decided, they differ so materially and radically in
their nature and purpose from the case under consideration,
that they form no basis for its decision. This association does
not meddle with prices and itself does no business. In refus-
ing to recognize any yard trader who is not a member of the
exchange, we see no purpose of thereby affecting or in any
manner restraining interstate commerce, which, if affected at
all, can only be in a very indirect and remote manner. The
rule has no direct tendency to diminish or in any way impede
or restrain interstate commerce in the cattle dealt in by de-
fendants. There is no tendency as a result of the rule, directly
or indirectly, to restrict the competition among defendants
for the class of cattle dealt in by them. Those who are sell-
ing the cattle have the market composed of defendants, and
also composed of the representative buyers of all the packing
houses at Kansas City, and also of the various commission
merchants who are constantly buying on orders and of those
who are buying on their own account. This makes a large
competition wholly outside of the defendants. The owner of

cattle for sale is, therefore, furnished with a market at which
the competition of buyers has a broad effect. All yard traders
have the- opportunity of becoming members of the exchange,
and to thus obtain all the advantages thereof.
The design of the defendants evidently is to bring all the
yard traders into the association as members, so that they
may become subject to its jurisdiction and be compelled by its
rules and regulations to transact business in the honest and
straightforward manner provided for by them. If while en-
forcing the rules those members who use improper methods
oi who fail to conduct their business transactions fairly and
honestly are disciplined and expelled, and thereby the number
of members is reduced, and'to that extent the number of com-
petitors limited, yet all this is done, not with the intent or
purpose of affecting in the slightest degree interstate trade
or commerce, and such trade or commerce can be affected
thereby only most remotely and indirectly, and if, for the
purpose of compelling this membership, the association refuse
business relations with those commission merchants who in-
sist upon buying from or selling to yard traders who are not
members of the association, we see nothing that can be said
to affect the trade or commerce in question other than in the
most roundabout and indirect manner. The agreement relates
to the action of the associates themselves, and it places in
effect no tax upon any instrument or subject of commerce ;
it exacts no license from parties engaged in the commercial
pursuits, and prescribes no condition in accordance with
which commerce in particular articles or between particu-
lar places is required to be conducted. Sherlock v. AZling,
93 U. S. 99; Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465, 473; Pitts-
burg and Southern Coal Company v. Louisiana,1 56 U. S. 590,
598.
If for the purpose of enlarging the membership of the ex-
change, and of thus procuring the transaction of their business
upon a proper and fair basis by all who are engaged therein,
the defendants refuse to do business with those commission
men who sell to or purchase from yard traders who are not
members of the exchange, the possible effect of such a course
