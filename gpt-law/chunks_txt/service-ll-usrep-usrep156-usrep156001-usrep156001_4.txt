Counsel contend that this definition, as explained by the
derivation of the word, may be applied to all cases in which
"one person sells alone the whole of any kind of marketable
thing, so that only he can continue to sell it, fixing the price
at his own pleasure," whether by virtue of legislative grant or
agreement, that the monopolization referred to in the act of
Congress is not confined to the common law sense of the term
as implying an exclusive control, by authority, of one branch
of industry without legal right of any other person to
interfere therewith by competition or otherwise, but that it
includes engrossing as well, and covers controlling the market
by contracts securing the advantage of selling alone or exclu-
sively all, or some considerable portion, of a particular kind
of merchandise or commodity to the detriment of the public,
and that such contracts amount to that restraint of trade
or commerce declared to be illegal. But the monopoly and
restraint denounced by the act are the monopoly and re-
straint of interstate and international trade or commerce,
while the conclusion to be assumed on this record is that the
result of the transaction complained of was the creation of a
monopoly in the manufacture of a necessary of life.
In the view which we take of the case, we need not discuss
whether because the tentacles which drew the outlying refin-
eries into the dominant corporation were separately put out,
therefore there was no combination to monopolize, or, because,
according to political economists, aggregations of capital may
reduce prices, therefore the objection to concentration of
power is relieved, or, because others were theoretically left

free to go into the business of refining sugar, and the original
stockholders of the Philadelphia refineries after becoming
stockholders of the American Company might go into compe-
tition with themselves, or, parting with that stock, might set
up again for themselves, therefore no objectionable restraint
was imposed.
The fundamental question is, whether conceding that the ex-
istence of a monopoly in manufacture is established by the
evidence, that monopoly can be directly suppressed under the
act of Congress in the mode attempted by this bill.
It cannot be denied that the power of a State to protect the
lives, health, and property of its citizens, and to preserve good
order and the public morals, "the power to govern men and
things within the limits of its dominion," is a power originally
and always belonging to the States, not surrendered by them
to the general government, nor directly restrained by the CoT-
stitution of the United States, and essentially exclusive. The
relief of the citizens of each State from the burden of monop-
oly and the evils resulting from the restraint of trade among
such citizens was left with the States to deal with, and this.
court has recognized their possession of that power even to the
extent of holding that an employment or busihess carried on
by private individuals, when it becomes a matter of such pub-
lic interest and importance as to create a common charge or
burden upon the citizen, m other words, when it becomes a
practical monopoly, to which the citizen is compelled to resort
and by means of which a tribute can be exacted from the com-
munity, is subject to regulation by state legislative power. On.
the other hand, the power of Congress to regulate commerce
among the several States is also exclusive. The Constitution
does not provide that interstate commerce shall be free, but,
by the grant of this exclusive power to regulate it, it was left
free except as Congress might impose restraints. Therefore
it has been determined that the failure of Congress to exercise
this exclusive power in any case is an expression of its will
that the subject shall be free from restrictions or impositions.
upon it by the several States, and if a law passed by a State in
the exercise of its acknowledged powers comes into conflict,

with that will, the Congress and the State cannot occupy the
position of equal opposing sovereignties, because the Constitu-
tion declares its supremacy and that of the laws passed in pur-
:suance thereof, and that which is not supreme must yield to
that which is supreme. "Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic,"
said Chief Justice Marshall, "but it is something more, it is
intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between
nations and parts of nations in all its branches, and is regu-
lated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse."
That which belongs to commerce is within the jurisdiction of
the United States, but that which does not belong to com-
merce is within the jurisdiction of the police power of the
State. Gibbons v Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189, 210 Brown v
-Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 448, Thie Iwcense Cases, 5 How

The argument is that the power to control the manufac-
ture of refined sugar is a monopoly over a necessary of life,
to the enjoyment of which by a large part of the population
of the United States interstate commerce is indispensable, and
that, therefore, the general government in the exercise of the
power to regulate commerce may repress such monopoly
directly and set aside the instruments which have created it.
But this argument cannot be confined to necessaries of life
merely, and must include all articles of general consumption.
Doubtless the power to control the manufacture of a given
thing involves in a certain sense the control of its disposition,
but this is a secondary and not the primary sense, and al-
though the exercise of that power may result in bringing the
operation of commerce into play, it does not control it, and
affects it only incidentally and indirectly Commerce suc-
ceeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it. The power to
regulate commerce is the power to prescribe the rule by which
commerce shall be governed, and is a power independent of
the power to suppress monopoly But it may operate in re-
pression of monopoly whenever that comes within the rules by
which commerce is governed or whenever the transaction is
itself a monopoly of commerce.
