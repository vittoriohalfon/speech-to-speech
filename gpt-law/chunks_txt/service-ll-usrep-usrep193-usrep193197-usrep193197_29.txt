separately. There was no desire or intent to evade the
Anti-Trust Act, to restrain competition, to monopolize
trade, to inflate securities, water stock, or create fictitious
capital.
I. It is not denied that the Northern Securities Company
is a corporation lawfully organized under the laws of the
State of New Jersey, with charter power to purchase and
sell securities of all kinds, and to purchase, hold, vote and
sell all the shares of stock of any single corporation or of
non-competing corporations. Its right to purchase, hold, vote
and sell all the stock of the Great Northern Railway Com-
pany alone, or the Northern Pacific Railway Company alone,
is not denied.
II. The organization of the company was the result of a
plan to form an investment or holding company, which had
its inception years before its articles were filed, among not ex-
ceeding ten large holders of Great Northern stock, who had
taken an active interest in the policy of the company and its
administration, but who never had held in the aggregate to
exceed one-fourth of its outstanding stock. It was thought
that if a company were formed to which they might sell their
individual holdings, their shares would be likely to be held to-
gether, so long as a majority of the holding company should
wish, and that this would tend to give stability to the policy
of the company, be of aid to it in its financial operations, and
maintain the value of its investments.
III. The Burlington purchase was made to enlarge trade,
not to restrain it; to increase competition, not to suppress it.
At the time of the purchase it was not contemplated by either
purchasing company or its shareholders that any alliance
between the purchasing company or its shareholders was
needed to preserve to each company its fair share of the ad-
vantages secured by the purchase.
IV. At the time of the organization of the Securities Com-
pany the Great Northern shareholders referred to owned
about $30,000,000 of Great Northern stock, and $35,000,000

Brief of Mr. Grover for Great Northern Railway. 193 U. S.
of Northern Pacific common stock, having increased their
holdings of the latter by purchases from J. P. Morgan & Co.
They did not control a majority of the shares of either of the
defendant railway companies. In view of the injury appre-
hended to both companies, and their shareholders, and the
better to protect their interests in the future, against raids of
adverse interests, the Great Northern shareholders referred to
deemed it advisable that the holding company which they had
considered should be organized, should have power to pur-
chase, not only their own Great Northern and Northern Pa-
cific shares, but also the shares of such other Great Northern
and Northern Pacific shareholders as might wish to sell their
stock to it, and also the shares of companies already formed,
and others that might be formed, for the purpose of aiding
the traffic operations of the Great Northern and Northern
Pacific companies.
V. At this time it was not expected by any of the persons
concerned, that any Northern Pacific shares, except the
$42,000,000 owned by them and by J. P. Morgan & Co. would
be acquired by the proposed holding company. The or-
ganization of the company was not dependent on any agree-
ment that it should acquire, nor upon the question of, a
majority of the shares of either of the defendant railway com-
panies. There was no agreement or understanding between
the Great Northern shareholders referred to, that they or
either of them would undertake to influence any one of the
other 1,800 Great Northern shareholders, or of the other 3,600
Northern Pacific shareholders, to sell their shares to the com-
pany.
VI. The Great Northern shareholders referred to, upon the
organization of the Northern Securities Company and the sale
of their shares to it, parted with such stock control as they
had in the Great Northern and Northern Pacific companies.
They do not own to exceed one-third of the outstanding capi-
tal stock of the Securities Company. At. the time of the
trial the stock of the Securities Company was held by 1,800

separate owners. The stock control of the Securities Com-
pany is, therefore, not in the eight or ten Great Northern
shareholders referred to, but in the 1,790 other shareholders
of the Securities Company, owning at least two-thirds of its
outstanding shares.
VII. Nothing has been done except the purchase by the
Securities Company of a majority of the stock of the Great
Northern and Northern Pacific companies.
VIII. The Securities Company as owner of the stock so
purchased may sell it or pledge it. It has made no agreement
as to what it will do with it, or how it will vote it, or how it
will dispose of the dividends received upon it. It is not a
trustee of those from whom it received such shares, and owes
them no duty or obligation respecting the shares, since they
have no further interest in them.
IX. It is not claimed or pretended that the defendant rail-
way companies have entered into any contract or combination
in restraint of trade, or that either of them has done anything
to restrain trade or in violation of law. It is not claimed that
the Securities Company can restrain trade, except through the
exercise of its right, as owner of the shares it purchased, to
vote them at stockholders' meetings, in the election of a sepa-
rate board of directors for each of the defendant railway com-
panies; for the boards must be separate under the laws of the
States of Minnesota and Wisconsin.
X. This suit was not brought to prevent or restrain the ex-
ecution of a contract, or the forming of a combination, in re-
straint of trade, but to restrain the Securities Company from
voting the stock it owns at stockholders' meetings, and from
receiving dividends thereon, thereby preventing payment of
dividends upon its own shares issued in payment for the shares
it purchased, upon the ground that mere possession of the vot-
ing power of the shares, is an unlawful restraint and regula-
tion of the interstate commerce of the defendant railway com-
panies.
XI. The Government has no financial interest in this suit.
