alone arise from the Ohio law, the corporation could not avail
of that law and avoid the condition which the law imposed.
Speaking of the consolidation, the court said (p. 440):
"The rights thus sought could only be acquired by the grant
of the State of Ohio, and depended for their existence upon the
provisions of its laws. Without that State's consent they could
not have been procured."
And, after a copious review of the authorities concerning the
power of the State over the consolidation, the case was summed
up by the court in the following passage (p. 446):
"Considering, as we do, that the payment of the charge was
a condition imposed by the State of Ohio upon the taking of
corporate being or the exercise of corporate franchises, the
right to which depended solely on the will of that State," (italics
mine,) "and hence that liability for the charge was entirely
optional, we conclude that the exaction constituted no tax
upon interstate commerce, or the right to carry on the same,
or the instruments thereof, and that its enforcement involved
no attempt on the part of the State to extend its taxing power
beyond its territorial limits."
How a right which was thus decided to depend solely upon
the authority of the States can now be said to depend solely
upon the will of Congress, I do not perceive.
In United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1,t he facts and
the relief based on them were thus stated by Mr. Chief Justice
Fuller, delivering the opinion of the court (p. 9):
"By the purchase of the stock of the four Philadelphia
refineries, with shares of its own stock, the American Sugar
Refining Company acquired nearly complete control of the
manufacture of refined sugar within the United States. The
bill charged that the contracts under which these purchases
were made constituted combinations in restraint of trade, and
that in entering into them the defendants combined and con-
spired to restrain the trade and commerce in refined sugar
among the several States and with foreign nations, contrary
to the act of Congress of July 2, 1890."

After referring, in a general way, to what constituted a
monopoly or restraint of trade at common law, the question for
decision was thus stated (p. 11):
"The fundamental question is, whether conceding that the
existence of a monopoly in manufacture is established by the
evidence, that monopoly can be directly suppressed under the
act of Congress in the mode attempted by this bill."
Examining this question as to the power of Congress, it was
observed (p. 11):
"It cannot be denied that the power of a State to protect
the lives, health and property of its citizens, and to preserve
good order and the public morals, 'the power to govern men
and things within the limits of its dominion,' is a power origi-
nally and always belonging to the States, not surrendered by
them to the general government, nor directly restrained by
the Constitution of the United States, and essentially exclu-
sive."
Next, pointing out that the power of Congress over interstate
commerce and the fact that its failure to legislate over subjects
requiring uniform legislation expressed the will of Congress
that the State should be without power to act on that subject,
the court came to consider whether the power of Congress to
regulate commerce embraced the authority to regulate and
control the ownership of stock in the state sugar refining com-
panies, because the products of such companies when manu-
factured might become the subject of interstate commerce.
Elaborately passing upon that question and reaffirming the
definition of Chief Justice Marshall of commerce, in the con-
stitutional sense, it was held that, whilst the power of Congress
extended to commerce as thus defined, it did not embrace the
ownership of stock in state corporations, because the products
of such manufacture might subsequently become the subject
of interstate commerce.
The parallel between the two cases is complete. The one
corporation acquired the stock of other and competing corpo-
rations by exchange for its own, It was conceded, for the

purposes of the case, that in doing so monopoly had been
brought about in the refining of sugar, that the sugar to be
produced was likely to become the subject of interstate com-
merce, and indeed that part of it would certainly become so.
But the power of Congress was decided not to extend to the
subject, because the ownership of the stock in the corporations
was not itself commerce.
In Pearsall v. The Great Northern Railway Company, 161
U. S. 646, the question was whether the acquisition by the
Great Northern road of a controlling interest in the stock of
the Northern Pacific Railway Company was a violation of a
Minnesota statute prohibiting the consolidation of competing
lines. It is at once evident that if the subject of consolidation
was within the authority of Congress, as Congress had not
expressed its will upon the subject, the act of the legislature
of Minnesota was void because repugnant to the Constitution
of the United States. But the possibility of such a contention
was not thought of by either party to the cause or by the court
itself. Treating the power of the State as undoubted, the court,
speaking through Mr. Justice Brown, decided that the Min-
nesota, law should be enforced. It was pointed out in the
opinion that, as the charter was one granted by the State, the
railroad company and the ownership of stock therein was sub-
ject to the state law, and this was made the basis of the decision.
Whilst, however, resting its conclusion upon the power of tile
State over the corporation by it created, the court was careful
to recognize that the authority in the State was so complete,
as the company was a state corporation, that the State had
the right, if it chose to do so, to authorize the consolidation, even
although the lines were competing.
In Louisville & Nashiille Railroad v. Kentucky, 161 U. S.
677, the power of the State to pass a law forbidding the con-
solidation of competing state railroad corporations doing in
part an interstate commerce business was again considered, and
a state statute in which the power was exercised was upheld.
!Jere, again, it is to be observed that if the consolidation of
