admissible on-public policy. If this one is of that character
it must fail, but if not, it cannot be made unlawful because
it is unnecessary. Few special contracts would be necessary
if all parties concerned in the transactions to which they refer
would always do right.
M'. George F. Edmunds for the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company, appellee.
Before the agreement in question was made, the rates of
each road had been independently and fairly established by
itself, and dhly filed with the Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion; and these rates were in truth just, reasonable, and in
conformity with law in every respect, and were in full opera-
tion.
This is admitted by pleadings.
This being true, these rates could not have been either
raised or lowered, under then existing conditions, without in-
justice to patrons or else injustice to those interested in the
roads, including the people along their lines, as .well as through-
shippers.
To have changed any of them would have been against jus-
tice and reason, disobeying the first commandment of the
commerce law.
In this state of things the agreement was made. The pre-
amble contains five distinct declarations, as follows:
(1) To aid in fulfilling the purposes of the Interstate Com-
merce act; to cobperate
(2) with each other and adjacent transportation associations
to establish and maintain
(3) reasonable and just rates, fares, rules and regulations
on state and interstate traffic; to
(4) prevent unjust discrimination, and to secure the reduc-
tion and concentration of agencies
(5) and the introduction of economies in the conduct of the
freight and passenger service.
Every one of these declarations is admitted to have beeh
true in all respects; and it is admitted that there was no other.

purpose, and no secret or covert, design in respect of the sub-
ject. The preamble thus became, certainly as between the
parties to it, the constitutional guide in the interpretation of
the body of the contract.
The parties next declare that. they "make this agreement
for the purpose of carrying out the objects above named."
The first six articles of the contract provide for organiza-
tion and administration, in respect of which no criticism has
been suggested, except as to section 5 of Article V in con-
nection with the Solicitor General's contention in regard to
Article VI.
Article VII is the first one that is assailed in respect of its
fundamental character. It is the fundamental one. in regard
to rates. If it violates law, it is bad, and must not be put in
execution. If it provides for the fullest obedience to law and
promotes trade, it must be upheld.
The first section provides:
"S aenox 1. The duly published .schedules of rates, fares
and charges and the rules applicable thereto now in force and
authorized by the companies parties hereto upon the traffic
covered by this agreement (and file.d with the Interstate Com-
merce Commission as to such of said traffic as is interstate)
are hereby reaffirmed by the companies composing the, asso-
ciation, and the companies parties hereto'shall, within ten
days after this agreement becomes effective, file with the
managers copies of all such schedules of rates. fares and
charges, and the rules applicable thereto."
This section is the immediate and affirmative act of the
association. Its essence is that all parties agree to abide by
the pre~xisling just, reasonable and lawful rates then on file
with the Interstate Commerce Commission. It has not been
contended by the learned Solicitor General that this section is
contrary to law. It is submitted with confidence that no such
conteption can be .made, and that if the association agree-
ment had stopped there, the agreement would have been sim-
ply one to stand by just and reasonable rates independently
fixed, on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission,
which would be agreeing to do the very thing that the plain

words of the statute commanded should be done. The com-
merce law does not demand competition; it only demands
justice, reason and equality. Every one of its clauses is de-
voted directly to these ends; and the competition that pro-
duces departure from the reason and justice and equality that
the act requires violates the essential principle upon which it
is founded.
I take it to be plain that if these thirty-one defendants had
united in an engagement to truly and faithfully adhere to and
carry out in their respective conduct all the requitements of
the commerce law, and had agreed to the imposition of penal-
ties for infraction, it would be manifest that they had not con-
tracted to restrain trade, either in a general or a partial sense,
or any sense whatever. In the instance of this first provision
of the agreement, they have engaged to do that very thing
and that very thing only in the form of specific language
referring to a specific and existing just, reasonable and lawful
state of things which they were then acting upon.
The second section of Article VII is the one upon which the
principal assault of my learned brother on the other side is
made. He maintains that the language used in describing
the powers and duties of the managers is intended to be
evasive and to conceal its real purpose, and to make the man-
agers the absolute masters, subject to an appeal to the board
of control (being the presidents of all the roads), of the chang-
ing and fixing of future rates. Ther first answer to this is that
the pleadings distinctly admit that there was no evasive in-
tention, or other unjust purpose, in any part of the arrange-
ment. It is, therefore, not just to maintain what the record
admits to be untrue.
But whatever construction or implication may exist in respect
of the language of this section, it is sufficient to say that the
very next section of the same article declares that
"The powers conferred upon the managers shall be so con-
strued and exercised as not to permit violation of the Interstate
Commerce act, or any other law applicable to the premises,
or any provision of the charters or the laws applicable to any
of the companies parties hereto, and the managers shall co-
