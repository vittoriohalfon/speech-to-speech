market for sale they will consign it to the solicitor's princi-
pal, so that he may perform such services as may be neces-
sary to sell the stock for them- and account to them for-
the proceeds thereof. Unlike the drummer who contracts,
in one State for the sale of goods which are in another, and
which are to be thereafter delivered in the State in which the
contract is made, the solicitor in this case has no goods or
samples of goods and negotiates no sales, and merely seeks to
exact a promise from the owner of property that when he
does wish to sell he will consign to and sell the property
through the solicitor's principal. There is no interstate com-
merce in that business.
Hooer v. California, 155 U. S.6 48, is another illustration
of the meaning of the term "commerce," as used in the Con-
stitution of the United States. In that case, contracts of
marine insurance are stated not to appertain to interstate
commerce, and cases are cited upon the nature of the con-
tract of insurance generally at page 653 of the opinion.
It is also to be remarked that the effect of the agreement
as to the number of solicitors to be employed by defendants
can only be remote and indirect upon interstate commerce.
The number of solicitors employed has no direct effect upon
the number of cattle transported from State to State. The
solicitors do not solicit transportation of the cattle. They
are not in the interest of the transportation company, and.
the transportation is an incident only. They solicit a con-
signment of cattle to their principals, so that the latter may
sell them on commission and thus transact their local business.
The transportation would take place any way and the cattle
be consigned for sale by some one of the defendants or by
others engaged in the business. It is not a matter of trans-
portation but one of agreement as to who shall render the
services of selling the cattle for their owner at the place of.
destination.
We say nothing against the constitutional right of each one
of the defendants and each person doing business at the Kansas
City stock yards to send into distant States and Territories as
many solicitors as the business of each will warrant. This

original right is not denied or questioned. But cannot the
citizefi, for what he thinks good reason, contract to curtail
that right? To say that a State would not have the right to
prohibit a defendant from employing as many solicitors as he
might choose, proves nothing in regard to the right of indi-
viduals to agree upon that subject in a way which they may
think the most conducive to their own interests. What a
State may do is one thing, and what parties may contract
voluntarily to do among themselves is quite another thing.
The liberty of contract as referred to in Allgeyer v. Louii-
ana, 165 U. S. 578, is the liberty of the individual to be free,
under certain circumstances, from the restraint of legislative
control with regard to all his contracts, but the case has no
reference to the right of individuals to sometimes enter into
those voluntary contracts by which their rights and duties
may properly be measured and defined and in many cases
greatly restrained and limited.
We agree with the court below in thinking there is not the
slightest materiality in the fact that the state line runs
through the stock yards in question, resulting in some of the
pens in which the stock may be confined being partly in the
State of Kansas and partly in the State of Missouri, and that
sales may be made of a lot of stock which may be at the
time partly in one State and partly in the other.' The erec-
tion of the building and the putting up of the stock pens upon
the ground through which the state line ran were matters of
no moment so far as any question of interstate commerce is
concerned. The character of the business done is not in the
least altered by these immater; I and incidental facts.
It follows from what has been -id that the complainants
have failed to show the defendants guilty of any violations of
the act of Congress, because it does not appear that the de-
fendants are engaged in interstate commerce, or that any
agreements or contracts made by them and relating to the con-
duct of their business are in restraint of any such commerce.
Whether they refused to transact business *hich is not
interstate commerce, except with those who are members of
the exchange, and whether such refusal is justifiable or not,

ANDERSON v.. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 181. Argued February 25, 28, 1898.- Decided October 24, 1898.
The Traders' Live Stock Exchange was an unincorporated association in
Kansas City, whose members bore much the same relation to it, and
through it carried on much the same business as that carried on by the
members of the Kansas City Live Stock Exchange, considered and passed
upon in Hopkins v. United States, just decided. The main difference was,
that the members of the Traders' Exchange, defendants in the present
proceedings, were themselves purchasers of cattle on the market, while
the defendants In the former case were commission merchants who sold
cattle upon commission as a compensation for their service. The
articles of association of the Traders' Exchange contained the follow-
ing preamble: 1. We, the undersigned, for the purpose of organizing and
maintaining a business exchange, not for pecuniary profit or gain, but to
promote and protect all interests connected with the buying and selling of
live stock at the Kansas City Stock Yards, and to cultivate courteous and
manly conduct towards each other, and give dignity and responsibility to
yard traders, have associated ourselves together under the name of
Traders' Live Stock Exchangd, and hereby agree, each with the other,
that we will faithfully observe and be bound by the following rules and
by-laws and such new rules, additions or amendments as may from time to
time be adopted in conformity with the provisions thereof from the date
of organization." The rules objected to in the bill in this case were the
following: "Rule 10. This exchange will not recognize any yard trader
unless he is a member of the Traders' Live Stock Exchange. Rule 11.
