190 U. S. Opinion of the Court.
the railroad companies and others unknown, to obtain a
monopoly of the supply and distribution of fresh meats through-
out the United States, etc. And to that end defendants
artificially restrain the commerce and put arbitrary regulations
in force affecting the same from the shipment of the live stock
from the plains to the final distribution of the meats to the
consumers. There is a prayer for an injunction of the most
comprehensive sort, against all the foregoing proceedings and
others, for discovery of books and papers relating directly or
indirectly to the purchase or shipment of live stock, and the
sale or shipment of fresh meat, and for an answer under oath.
The injunction issued is appended in a note.1
I "And now, upon motion of the said attorney, the court doth order that
the preliminary injunction heretofore awarded in this cause, to restrain the
said defendants and each of them, their respective agents and attorneys,
and all other persons acting in their behalf, or in behalf of either of them,
or claiming so to act, from entering into, taking part in, or performing any
contract, combination or conspiracy, the purpose or effect of which will be,
as to trade and commerce in fresh meats between the several States and
Territories and the District of Columbia, a restraint of trade, in violation of
the provisions of the act of Congress approved July 2, 1890, entitled 'An act
to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies,'
either by directing or requirin. their respective agents to refrain from bidding
against each other in the purchase of live stock; or collusively and by agree-
ment to refrain from bidding against each other at the sales of live stock; or
by combination, conspiracy or contract raising or lowering prices or fixing
uniform prices at which the said meats will be sold, either directly or through
their respective agents; or by curtailing the quantity of such meats shipped
to such markets and agents; or by establishing and maintaining rules for
the giving of credit to dealers in such meats, the effect of which rules will be
to restrict competition; or by imposing uniform charges for cartage and
delivery of such meats to dealers and consumers, the effect of which will be
to restrict competition; or by any other method or device, the purpose and
effect of which is to restrain commerce as aforesaid; and also from violating
the provisions of the act of Congress approved July 2, 1890, entitled 'An
act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and mo-
nopolies,' by combining or conspiring together, or with each other and
others, to monopolize or attempt to monopolize any part of the trade and
commerce in fresh meats among the several States and Territories and the
District of Columbia, by demanding, obtaining, or, with or without the
connivance of the officers or agents thereof, or of any of them, receiving from
railroad companies or other common carriers transporting such fresh meats

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court. 196 U. S.
To sum up the bill more shortly, it charges a combination
of a dominant proportion of the dealers in fresh meat through-
out the United States/not to bid against each other in the live
stock markets of the different States, to bid up prices for a
few days in order to induce the cattle men to send their stock
to the stock yards, to fix prices at which they will sell, and to
that end to restrict shipments of meat when necessary, to
establish a uniform rule of credit to dealers and to keep a
black list, to make uniform and improper charges for cartage,
and finally, to get less than lawful rates from the railroads to
the exclusion of competitors. It -is true that the last charge
is not clearly stated to be a part of the combination. But as
it is alleged that the defendants have each and all made ar-
rangements with the railroads, that they were exclusively to
enjoy the unlawful advantage, and that their intent in what
they did was to monopolize the commerce and to prevent coni-
petition, and in view of the general allegation to which we
in such trade and commerce, either directly or by means of rebates, or by
any other device, transportation of or for such means, from the points of
the preparation and production of the same from live stock or elsewhere, to
the markets for the sale of the same to dealers and consumers in other States
and Territories than those wherein the same are so prepared, or the District
of Columbia, at less than the regular rates which may be established or in
force on their several lines of transportation, under the provisions in that
behalf of the laws of the said United States for the regulation of commerce,
be and the same is hereby made perpetual.
"But nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the said defendants
from agreeing upon charges for cartage and delivery, and other incidents
connected with local sales, where such charges are not calculated to have
any effect upon competition in the sales and delivery of meats; nor from
establishing and maintaining rules for the giving of credit to dealers where
such rules in good faith are calculated solely to protect the defendants against
dishonest or irresponsible dealers, nor from curtailing the quantity of meats
shipped to a given market where the purpose of such arrangement in good
faith is to prevent the over-accumulation of meats as perishable articles in
such markets.
"Nor shall anything herein contained be construed to restrain or inter-
fere with the action of any single company or firm, by its or their officers
or agents (whether such officers or agents are themselves personally made
parties defendant hereto or not) acting with respect to its or their own
corporate or firm business, property or affairs."

19IU . S. Opinion of the Court.
shall refer, we think that we have stated correctly the purport
of the bill. It will be noticed further that the intent to mo-
nopolize is alleged for the first time in the eighth section of the
bill as to raising, lowering and fixing prices. In the earlier
sections, the intent alleged is to restrain competition among
themselves. But after all the specific charges there is a gen-
eral allegation that the defendants are conspiring with one
another, the railroads and others, to monopolize the supply
and distribution of fresh meats throughout the United States,
etc., as has been stated above, and it seems to us that this
general allegation of intent colors and applies to all the specific
charges of the bill. Whatever may be thought concerning the
proper construction of the statute, a bill in equity is not to be
read and construed as an indictment would have been read and
construed a hundred years ago, but it is to be taken to mean
what it fairly conveys to a dispassionate reader by a fairly
exact use of English speech. Thus read this bill seems to us
intended to allege successive elements of a single connected
scheme.
We read the demurrer with the same liberality Therefore
we take it as applying to the bill generally for multifariousness
and want of equity, and also to each section of it which makes
a charge and to the discovery The demurrer to the discovery
will not need discussion in the view which we take concerning
the relief, and therefore we turn at once to that.
The general objection is urged that the bill does not set
forth sufficient definite or specific facts. This objection is
serious, but it seems to us inherent in the nature of the case.
The scheme alleged is so vast that it presents a new problem
in pleading. If, as we must assume, the scheme is enter-
tained, it is, of course, contrary to the very words of the
statute. Its size makes the violation of the law more con-
spicuous, and yet the same thing makes it impossible to fasten
the principal fact to a certain time and place. The elements,
too, are so numerous and shifting, even the constituent parts
alleged are and from their nature must be so extensive in time
