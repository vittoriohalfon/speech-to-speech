common law, are illegal and dangerous to the public welfare?
What clause of the Constitution can be referred to which pro-
hibits the means thus prescribed in the act of Congress2
It may be that the means employed by Congress to sup-
press combinations that restrain interstate trade and com-
merce are not all or the best that could have been devised.
But Congress. under the delegation of authority to enact laws
necessary and proper to carry into effect a power granted, is
not restricted to the employment of those means "without
which the end would be entirely unattainable." "To have
prescribed the means," this court has said, "by which govern-
ment should, in all future time, execute its powers, would have
been to change entirely the character of that instrument, and
give it the properties of a legal code. It would have been an
unwise attempt to provide, by immutable rules for exigencies
which, if foreseen at all, must have been seen dimly and
which can be best provided for as they occur. To have
declared that the best means shall not be used, but those
alone without which the power given would be nugatory,
would have been to deprive the legislature of the capacity to
avail itself of experience, to exercise its reason, and to accom-
modate its legislation to circumstances." Again "Where
the law is not prohibited, and is really calculated to effect any
of the objects entrusted to the government, to undertake here
to inquire into the degree of its necessity would be to pass the
line which circumscribes the judicial department, and to tread
on legislative ground." .M cCulloch v .Ma?'yland, 4 Wheat.
316, 415, 423.
By the act of 1890, Congress subjected to forfeiture "any
property owned under any contract or by any combination,
or pursuant to any conspiracy, (and being the subject thereof,)
mentioned in section one of this act, and being in the course
of transportation from one State to another, or to a foreign
country " It was not deemed wise to subject such property
to forfeiture before transportation began or after it ended. If
it be suggested that Congress might have prohibited the trans-
portatson from the State in which they are manufactured of
any articles, by whomsoever at the time owned, that had been

manufactured by combinations formed to monopolize some
designated part of trade or commerce among the States, my
answer is that it is not within the functions of the judiciary
to adjudge that Congress shall employ particular means in
execution of a given power, simply because such means are, in
the judgment of the courts, best conducive to the end sought
to be accomplished. Congress, in the exercise of its discretion
as to choice of means conducive to an end to which it was
competent, determined to reach that end through civil pro-
ceedings instituted to prevent or restrain these obnoxious com-
binations in their attempts to burden interstate commerce by
obstructions that interfere sn advance of transTvortation with
the free course of trade between the people of the States. In
other words, Congress sought to prevent the coming into
-existence of combinations, the purpose or tendency of which
was to impose unlawful restraints upon interstate commerce.
There is nothing in conflict with these views in Coe v.
Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 529. There the question was whether
certain logs cut in New Hampshire, and hauled to a river that
they might be transported to another State, were liable to be
taxed in the former State before actual transportation to the
latter State began. The court held that the logs might be
taxed while they remained in the State of their origin as part
of the general mass of property there, that "for ths pr-
_pose" - taxation - the property did not pass from the juris-
diction of the State in which it was until transportation began.
The scope of the decision is clearly indicated by the following
-clause in the opinion of Mr. Justice Bradley "How can
property thus situated, to wit, deposited or stored at the
place of entrep6t for future exportation, be taxed in the regu-
lar way as part of the property of the State 2 The answer is
plain. It can be taxed as all other property is taxed, in the
place where it is found, if taxed or assessed for taxation in the
usual manner in which such property is taxed, and not
singled out to be assessed by itself in an unusual and excep-
tional manner because of its situation." As we have now no
.question as to the taxation of articles manufactured by one
-of the combinations condemned by the act. of Congress, and

as no one has suggested that the State in which they may be
manufactured could not tax them as property so long as they
remained within its limits, and before transportation of them
to other States began, I am at a loss to understand how the
case before us can be affected by a decision that personal
property, while it remains in the State of its origin, although
it is to be sent at a future time to another State, is within the
jurisdiction of the former State for purposes of taxation.
The question here relates to restraints upon the freedom of
interstate trade and commerce imposed by illegal combina-
tions. After the fullest consideration I have been able to
bestow upon this important question, I find it impossible to-
refuse my assent to this proposition Whatever a State may
do to protect its completely interior traffic or trade against
unlawful restraints, the general government is empowered to
do for the protection of the people of all the States-for this
purpose one people - against unlawful restraints imposed upon
interstate traffic or trade in articles that are to enter into
commerce among the several States. If, as already shown, a
State may prevent or suppress a combmnation, the effect of
which is to subject its domestic trade to the restraints neces-
sarily arising from their obtaining the absolute control of the-
sale of a particular article in general use by the community,
there ought to be no hesitation in allowing to Congress the-
right to suppress a similar comlnation that imposes a like
unlawful restraint upon interstate trade and traffic in that
article. While the States retain, because they have never
surrendered, full control of their completely internal traffic,
it was not intended by the framers of the Constitution that
any part of interstate commerce should be excluded from the
control of Congress. Each State can reach and suppress com-
binations so far as they unlawfully restrain its interior trade,
while the national government may reach and suppress them
so far as they unlawfully restrain trade among the States.
While the opinion of the court in this case does not declare
the act of 1890 to be unconstitutional, it defeats the main
object for which it was passed. For it is, in effect, held that
the statute would be unconstitutional if interpreted as em-
