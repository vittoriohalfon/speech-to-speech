tory programs. Our decision was grounded in principles of
federalism. Id., at 350-352.
The principle of freedom of action for the States, adopted
to foster and preserve the federal system, explains the later
evolution and application of the Parkerd octrine in our deci-
sions in Midcal, supra, and Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94
(1988). In Midcal we invalidated a California statute for-
bidding licensees in the wine trade to sell below prices set
by the producer. There we announced the two-part test ap-
plicable to instances where private parties participate in a
price-fixing regime. "First, the challenged restraint must
be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as
state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised
by the State itself." 445 U. S., at 105 (internal quotation
marks omitted). Midcal confirms that while a State may
not confer antitrust immunity on private persons by fiat, it
may displace competition with active state supervision if the
displacement is both intended by the State and implemented
in its specific details. Actual state involvement, not defer-
ence to private price-fixing arrangements under the general
auspices of state law, is the precondition for immunity from
federal law. Immunity is conferred out of respect for on-
going regulation by the State, not out of respect for the
economics of price restraint. In Midcal we found that the
intent to restrain prices was expressed with sufficient preci-
sion so that the first part of the test was met, but that the
absence of state participation in the mechanics of the price
posting was so apparent that the requirement of active su-
pervision had not been met. Ibid.
The rationale was further elaborated in Patrick v. Burget.
In Patrick it had been alleged that private physicians partic-
ipated in the State's peer review system in order to injure
or destroy competition by denying hospital privileges to a
physician who had begun a competing clinic. We referred
to the purpose of preserving the State's own administrative

policies, as distinct from allowing private parties to foreclose
competition, in the following passage:
"The active supervision requirement stems from the rec-
ognition that where a private party is engaging in the
anticompetitive activity, there is a real danger that he
is acting to further his own interests, rather than the
governmental interests of the State. . . . The require-
ment is designed to ensure that the state-action doctrine
will shelter only the particular anticompetitive acts of
private parties that, in the judgment of the State, actu-
ally further state regulatory policies. To accomplish
this purpose, the active supervision requirement man-
dates that the State exercise ultimate control over the
challenged anticompetitive conduct .... The mere pres-
ence of some state involvement or monitoring does not
suffice.... The active supervision prong of the Midcal
test requires that state officials have and exercise power
to review particular anticompetitive acts of private par-
ties and disapprove those that fail to accord with state
policy. Absent such a program of supervision, there is
no realistic assurance that a private party's anticompeti-
tive conduct promotes state policy, rather than merely
the party's individual interests." 486 U. S., at 100-101
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
Because the particular anticompetitive conduct at issue in
Patrick had not been supervised by governmental actors, we
decided that the actions of the peer review committee were
not entitled to state-action immunity. Id., at 106.
Our decisions make clear that the purpose of the active
supervision inquiry is not to determine whether the State
has met some normative standard, such as efficiency, in its
regulatory practices. Its purpose is to determine whether
the State has exercised sufficient independent judgment and
control so that the details of the rates or prices have been
established as a product of deliberate state intervention, not

simply by agreement among private parties. Much as in
causation inquiries, the analysis asks whether the State has
played a substantial role in determining the specifics of the
economic policy. The question is not how well state regula-
tion works but whether the anticompetitive scheme is the
State's own.
Although the point bears but brief mention, we observe
that our prior cases considered state-action immunity
against actions brought under the Sherman Act, and this
case arises under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The
Commission has argued at other times that state-action im-
munity does not apply to Commission action under ยง 5 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U. S. C. ยง 45. See U. S.
Bureau of Consumer Protection, Staff Report to the Federal
Trade Commission on Prescription Drug Price Disclosures,
Chs. VI(B) and (C) (1975); see also Note, The State Action
Exemption and Antitrust Enforcement under the Federal
Trade Commission Act, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 715 (1976). A lead-
ing treatise has expressed its skepticism of this view. See
1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 218 (1978). We
need not determine whether the antitrust statutes can be
distinguished on this basis, because the Commission does not
assert any superior pre-emption authority in the instant
matter. We apply our prior cases to the one before us.
Respondents contend that principles of federalism justify
a broad interpretation of state-action immunity, but there is
a powerful refutation of their viewpoint in the briefs that
were filed in this case. The State of Wisconsin, joined by
Montana and 34 other States, has filed a brief as amici cu-
riae on the precise point. These States deny that respond-
ents' broad immunity rule would serve the States' best inter-
ests. We are in agreement with the amici submission.
If the States must act in the shadow of state-action immu-
nity whenever they enter the realm of economic regulation,
then our doctrine will impede their freedom of action, not
advance it. The fact of the matter is that the States regu-
