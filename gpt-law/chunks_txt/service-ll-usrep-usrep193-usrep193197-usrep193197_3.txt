to the public two parallel and competing transcontinental lines
connecting the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River with
Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean. At the times mentioned,
these two railway systems, which will hereafter be referred to
respectively as the Northern Pacific system and the Great
Northern system, each of which, with its leased and controlled
lines, main and branch, aggregates over 5,500 miles in length,
were the only transcontinental lines of railway extending across
the northern tier of States west of the Great Lakes, from the
Great Lakes and the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, and
were then engaged in active competition with one another for
freight and passenger traffic among the several States of the
United States and between such States and foreign countries,
each system connecting at its eastern terminals, not only with
lines of railway, but with lake and river steamers to other
States and to foreign countries, and at its western terminalÂ§
with sea-going vessels to other States, Territories, and posses-
sions of the United States and to foreign countries.
IV. Prior to the year 1893 the Northern Pacific system was
owned or controlled and operated by the Northern Pacific Rail-
road Company, a corporation organized and existing under cer-
tain acts and resolutions of Congress. During that year the
company became insolvent, and the line was placed in the hands
of receivers by the proper courts of the United States. While
in this condition, awaiting foreclosure and sale, an arrangement
was entered into between a majority of the bondholders of the
Northern Pacific Railroad Company and the defendant, the
Great Northern Railway Company, for a virtual consolidation
of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern systems and the
placing of the practical control of the Northern Pacific system
in the hands of the defendant, the Great Northern Railway
Company. This arrangement contemplated the sale, under
foreclosure, of the property and franchises of the Northern
Pacific Railroad Company to a committee of the bondholders,
who should organize a new corporation, to be known as the
Northern Pacific Railway Company, which was to become the

successor of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company; one-half
of the capital stock of the new company was to be turned over
to the shareholders of the defendant, the Great Northern Rail-
way Company, which in turn was to guarantee the payment of
the bonds of the Northern Pacific Railway Company. An
agreement was to be entered into for the exchange of traffic at
intersecting and connecting points and for the division of earn-
ings therefrom. The carrying out of this arrangement was de-
feated by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United
States in the case of Pearsall v. The Great Northern Railway
Company (which was decided March 30, 1896, and is reported
in the one hundred and sixty-first volume of the reports of
said court, beginning on page 646, to which reference is made),
in which it was held that the practical effect would be the con-
solidation of two parallel and competing lines of railway, and
the giving to the defendant, the Great Northern Railway Com-
pany, a monopoly of all traffic in the northern half of the State
of Minnesota, as well as of all transcontinental traffic north of
the line of the Union Pacific, to the detriment of the public
and in violation of the laws of the State of Minnesota.
V. Early in the year 1901 the defendants, the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific Railway companies, acting for the purpose
of promoting their joint interests, and in contemplation of the
ultimate placing of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific
systems under a common source of control, united in the pur-
chase of the total capital stock of the Chicago, Burlington and
Quincy Railway Company, of Illinois, giving the joint bonds
of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies,
payable in twenty years from date, with interest at 4 per cent
per annum, for such stock, at the rate of $200 in bonds in ex-
change for each $100 in stock, and in this manner purchased andi
acquired about $107,000,000 of the $112,000,000 total capital
stock of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railway Com-
pany, or about 98 per cent thereof. In this manner, at the time
stated, the defendants, the Great Northern and Northern Pacific
Railway companies, secured control of the vast system of rail-

way lines known as the Burlington system, about 8,000 miles
in length, extending from St. Paul, in the State of Minnesota,
where it connects with the Great Northern and Northern
Pacific Railway systems, through the States of Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and Illinois, to Chicago, in the State of Illinois,
and from these two cities through said States and through the
States of Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, South Dakota,
Wyoming, and Montana, to Quincy, in the State of Illinois;
to Burlington and Des Moines, in the State of Iowa; to St.
Louis, Kansas City, and St. Joseph, in the State of Missouri;
to Omaha and Lincoln, in, the State of Nebraska; to Denver,
in the State of Colorado; to Cheyenne, in the State of Wyo-
ming, and to Billings, in the State of Montana, where it again
connects with the Northern Pacific Railway system, these
States lying west of Chicago and south of the States crossed
by the Great Northern and Northern Pacific systems, and
constituting the territory occupied in part by what is known
as the Union Pacific Railway system, which has been and is a
parallel and competing system within said territory with the
said Burlington system.
VI. The attempt to turn over a controlling interest in the
stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company to the Great
Northern Railway Company and thus effect a virtual consolida-
tion of the two railway systems, having thus, in the year 1896,
been defeated by a decision of the Supreme Court of the United
States, the defendants James J. Hill and his associate stock-
holders of the defendant, the Great Northern Railway Com-
pany, owning or controlling a majority of the stock of that
corporation, and the defendants J. Pierpont Morgan and his
associate stockholders of the defendant, the Northern Pacific
Railway Company, owning or controlling a majority of the
stock of that corporation, acting for themselves as such stock-
holders and on behalf of the said railway companies in which
they owned or held a controlling interest, on and prior to the
13th day of November, 1901, contriving and intending unlaw-
fully to restrain the trade or commerce among the several States
