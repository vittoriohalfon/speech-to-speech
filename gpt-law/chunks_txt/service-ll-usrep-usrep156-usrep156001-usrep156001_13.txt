they desire to purchase, except at the przces fixed by such com-
binations. A citizen of Missouri has the right to go in per-
son, or send orders, to Pennsylvania and New Jersey for the
purpose of purchasing refined sugar. But of what value is
that right if he is confronted in those States by a vast corn-
bnmation which absolutely controls the price of that article by
reason of its having acquired all the sugar refineries in the
United States in order that they may fix prices in their own
interest exclusively2
In my judgment, the citizens of the several States com-
posing the Union are entitled, of right, to buy goods in the
State where they are manufactured, or in any other State,
without being confronted by an illegal combination whose
business extends throughout the whole country, which by the
law everywhere is an enemy to the public interests, and which
prevents such buying, except at prices arbitrarily fixed by it.
I insist that the free course of trade among the States cannot
coexist with such combinations. When I speak of trade I
mean the buying and selling of articles of every kind that are
recognized articles of interstate commerce. Whatever im-
properly obstructs the free course of interstate intercourse
and trade, as involved in the buying and selling of articles
to be carried from one State to another, may be reached by
Congress, under its authority to regulate commerce among the
States. The exercise of that authority so as to make trade
among the States, in all recognized articles of commerce,
absolutely free from unreasonable or illegal restrictions im-
posed by combinations, is justified by an express grant of
power to Congress and would redound to the welfare of the
whole country I am unable to perceive that any such result
would imperil the autonomy of the States, especially as that
result cannot be attained through the action of any one State.
Undue restrictions or burdens upon the purchasing of goods,
in the market for sale, to be transported to other States, can-
not be inposed even by a State without violating the freedom
of commercial intercourse guaranteed by the Constitution.
But if a State within whose limits the business of refining
sugar is exclusively carried on may not constitutionally ir-

pose burdens upon purchases of sugar to be transportedt o other
States, how comes it that combinations of corporations or indi-
viduals, within the same State, may not be prevented by the
national government from putting unlawful restraints upon
the purchasing of that article to be earredf rom the State in
which such purchases are made 9 If the national power is
competent to repress State action in restraint of interstate
trade as it may be involved in purchases of refined sugar
to be transported from one State to another State, surely it
ought to be deemed sufficient to prevent unlawful restraints
attempted to be imposed by combinations of corporations or
individuals upon those identical purchases, otherwise, illegal
combinations of corporations or individuals may -so far as
national power and interstate commerce are concerned -do,
with impunity, what no State can do.
Suppose that a suit were brought in one of the courts of
the United States -jurisdiction being based, it may be, alone
upon the diverse citizenship of the parties-to enforce the
stipulations of a written agreement, which had for its object
to acquire the possession of all the sugar refineries in the
United States, in order that those engaged m the combination
might obtain the entire control of the business of refining and
selling sugar throughout the country, and thereby to increase
or diminish prices as the particular interests of the combina-
tion might require. I take it that the court, upon recognized
principles of law common to the jurisprudence of this country
and of Great Britain, would deny the relief asked and dismiss
the suit upon the ground that the necessary tendency of such
an agreement and combination was to restrain, not simply
trade that was completely internal to the State in which the
parties resided, but trade and commerce among all the
States, and was, therefore, against public policy and illegal.
If I am right in this view, it would seem to follow, necessarily,
that Oongress could enact a statute forbidding such combina-
tions so far as they affected interstate commerce, and provide
for their suppression as well through civil proceedings insti-
tuted for that purpose, as by penalties against those engaged
in them.

In committing to Congress the control of commerce with
foreign nations and among the several States, the Constitution
did not define the means that may be employed to protect the
freedom of commercial intercourse and traffic established for
the benefit of all the people of the Union. It wisely forbore
to impose any limitations upon the exercise of that power
except those arising from the general nature of the govern-
ment, or such as are embodied in the fundamental guarantees
of liberty and property It gives to Congress, in express
words, authority to enact all laws necessary and proper for
carrying into execution the power to regulate commerce, and
whether an act of Congress, passed to accomplish an object to
winch the general government is competent, is within the
power granted, must be determined by the rule announced
through Chief Justice Marshall three-quarters of a century
ago, and which has been repeatedly affirmed by this court.
That rule is "The sound construction of the Constitution
must allow to the national legislature the discretion with
respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be
carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform
the high duties assigned to it m the manner most beneficial to
the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the
scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropri-
ate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not
prohibited, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the
Constitution, are constitutional." MoCulloch v. -farylan4
4 Wheat. 316, 421. The end proposed to be accomplished by
the act of 1890 is the protection of trade and commerce among
the States against unlawful restraints.. Who can say that that
end is not legitimate or is not within the scope of the Consti-
tution 2 The means employed are the suppression, by legal
proceedings, of combinations, conspiracies, and monopolies,
which by their inevitable and admitted tendency, improperly
restrain trade and commerce among the States. Who can say
that such means are not appropriate to attain the end of free-
ing commercial intercourse among the States from burdens
and exactions imposed upon it by combinations which, under
principles long recognized in this country as well as at the
