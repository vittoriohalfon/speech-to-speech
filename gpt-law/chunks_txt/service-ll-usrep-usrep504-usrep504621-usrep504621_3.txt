Opinion of the Court
The Commission issued an administrative complaint in
1985. Horizontal price fixing was alleged in these terms:
"'Respondents have agreed on the prices to be charged
for title search and examination services or settlement
services through rating bureaus in various states. Ex-
amples of states in which one or more of the respond-
ents have fixed prices with other respondents or other
competitors for all or part of their search and examina-
tion services or settlement services are Arizona, Con-
necticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, New Jersey, New
Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Wiscon-
sin and Wyoming."' 112 F. T. C., at 346.
The Commission did not challenge the insurers' practice of
setting uniform rates for insurance against the risk of loss
from defective titles, but only the practice of setting uniform
rates for the title search, examination, and settlement, as-
pects of the business which, the Commission alleges, do not
involve insurance.
Before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), respondents
defended against liability on three related grounds. First,
they maintained that the challenged conduct is exempt
from antitrust scrutiny under the McCarran-Ferguson Act,
59 Stat. 34, 15 U. S. C. ยง 1012(b), which confers antitrust
immunity over the "business of insurance" to the extent reg-
ulated by state law. Second, they argued that their collec-
tive ratemaking activities are exempt under the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine, which places certain "[j]oint efforts to
influence public officials" beyond the reach of the antitrust
laws. Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U. S. 657, 670
(1965); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr
Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127, 136 (1961). Third, re-
spondents contended their activities are entitled to state-
action immunity, which permits anticompetitive conduct if
authorized and supervised by state officials. See California
Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445

FTC v. TICOR TITLE INS. CO.
Opinion of the Court
U. S. 97 (1980); Parkerv . Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943). App.
to Pet. for Cert. 218a. As to one State, Ohio, respondents
contended that the rates for title search, examination, and
settlement had not been set by a rating bureau.
Title insurance company rates and practices in 13 States
were the subject of the initial complaint. Before the matter
was decided by the ALJ, the Commission declined to pursue
its complaint with regard to fees in five of these States:
Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Wyoming.
Upon the recommendation of the ALJ, the Commission did
not pursue its complaint with regard to fees in two additional
States, Idaho and Ohio. This left six States in which the
Commission found antitrust violations, but in two of these
States, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the Commission con-
ceded the issue on which certiorari was sought here, so the
regulatory regimes in these two States are not before us.
Four States remain in which violations were alleged: Con-
necticut, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Montana.
The ALJ held that the rates for search and examination
services had been fixed in these four States. For reasons we
need not pause to examine, the ALJ rejected the McCarran-
Ferguson and Noerr-Pennington defenses. The ALJ then
turned his attention to the question of state-action immunity.
A summary of the ALJ's extensive findings on this point is
necessary for a full understanding of the decisions reached
at each level of the proceedings in the case.
Rating bureaus are private entities organized by title in-
surance companies to establish uniform rates for their mem-
bers. The ALJ found no evidence that the collective setting
of title insurance rates through rating bureaus is a way of
pooling risk information. Indeed, he found no evidence that
any title insurer sets rates according to actuarial loss experi-
ence. Instead, the ALJ found that the usual practice is for
rating bureaus to set rates according to profitability studies
that focus on the costs of conducting searches and examina-
tions. Uniform rates are set notwithstanding differences in

efficiencies and costs among individual members. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 183a-184a.
The ALJ described the regulatory regimes for title insur-
ance rates in the four States still at issue. In each one, the
title insurance rating bureau was licensed by the State and
authorized to establish joint rates for its members. Each of
the four States used what has come to be called a "negative
option" system to approve rate filings by the bureaus.
Under a negative option system, the rating bureau filed rates
for title searches and title examinations with the state insur-
ance office. The rates became effective unless the State
rejected them within a specified period, such as 30 days. Al-
though the negative option system provided a theoretical
mechanism for substantive review, the ALJ determined,
after making detailed findings regarding the operation of
each regulatory regime, that the rate filings were subject to
minimal scrutiny by state regulators.
In Connecticut the State Insurance Department has the
authority to audit the rating bureau and hold hearings re-
garding rates, but it has not done so. The Connecticut rat-
ing bureau filed only two major rate increases, in 1966 and
in 1981. The circumstances behind the 1966 rate increase
are somewhat obscure. The ALJ found that the Insurance
Department asked the rating bureau to submit additional in-
formation justifying the increase, and later approved the
rate increase although there is no evidence the additional
information was provided. In 1981 the Connecticut rating
bureau filed for a 20 percent rate increase. The factual
background for this rate increase is better developed though
the testimony was somewhat inconsistent. A state insur-
ance official testified that he reviewed the rate increase with
care and discussed various components of the increase with
the rating bureau. The same official testified, however, that
he lacked the authority to question certain expense data he
considered quite high. Id., at 189a-195a.
