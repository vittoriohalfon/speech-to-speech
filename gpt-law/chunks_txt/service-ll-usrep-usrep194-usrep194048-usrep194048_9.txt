OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court. 194 U. S.
and Northern Pacific Railway companies and to carry out the
purpose and object of its incorporation, full faith arid credit
will not be given to the public acts of the State. Thi.s, it is
contended, presents a case arising under Article IV of the
Constitution, providing that "full faith and credit shall be
given in each State to the public acts, records and judicial
proceedings of every other State."' It is said by the state's
counsel.that the "gravamen of the charge in appellant's com-
plaint is that the defendants created a corponation device in
New Jersey and used it for the purpose and with the result that
property rights in Minnesota were affected, in violation of its
laws. Our contention is that Article IV must be so construed
as to make the constitutional enactment of Minnesota effective
throughout the United States, so far as they apply to and
affect property rights within the State. Otherwise the policy
and laws of any State may be easily evaded." We (1o not
think-that the clause of the Constitution above quoted has any
bearing whatever upon the question under consideratioi. It
only prescribes a rule by which courts, Federal and state, arc
to be guided when a question arises in the progress of a pending
suit as to the faith and credit to be given by the court to the
publia acts, records and judicial proceedings of a State other
than that in which the court is sitting. Even if it be assumed
that the word "acts" includes "statutes," the clause has noth-
ing to do with the conduct of individuals or corporations; and
to invoke the rule which it prescribes does not make a case
arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States.
What was the duty of the Circuit Court when it ascertained
that the suit was not one of which it could take cognizance?
The answer is indicated by the clause of the Judiciary Act of
March 3, 1875, to which we have adverted.
For the reasons stated, we are of opinion that the suit does
not-to use the words of the act of 1875-really and substan-
tially involve a dispute or controversy within the jurisdiction
of the Circuit Court for the purposes of a final decree. Western

BEAVERS v. HENKEL.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF- THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 535. Argued March 9, 10, 1904.-Decided April 11, 1904.
Statutory provisions must be interpreted in the light of all that may be done
under them. In all controversies, civil and criminal, between the Gov-
ernment and an individual, the latter is entitled to reasonable protection.
The Fifth Amendment is satisfied by one inquiry and adjudication, and an
indictment found by the proper grand jury should be accepted any-
where within the United States as at least prima Jacie evidence of probable
cause and sufficient basis for removal from the district where the person
arrested is found to the district where the indictment was found.
The place where such inquiry must be had, and the decision of the grand jury
obtained, is the locality in which by the Constitution and laws the final
trial must be had.
ON July 23, 1903, a grand jury of the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Eastern District of New York found and
returned an indictment under section 1781, Rev. Stat., charg-
ing George W. Beavers, an officer of the government of the
United States, with having received money for procuring a
contract with the government for the Edward J. Brandt-Dent
'Company. A warrant for the arrest of the official was issued
to the marshal of the district and returned "not found."
Thereupon a complaint supported by affidavit was filed in the
District Court of the United States for the Southern District
of New York, alleging the finding of the indictment, the issue
