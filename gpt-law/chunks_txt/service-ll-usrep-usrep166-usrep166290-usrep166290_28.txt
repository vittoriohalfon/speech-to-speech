constant and daily change of rates between connecting or
competing lines, thus avoiding discrimination and preference
as to persons and places.
The second of these systems is, I submit, plainly the one
embodied in the Interstate Commerce Act. At the outset
reasonable rates are exacted, and the power to strike down
rates which are unreasonable is provided. In the subsequent
provisions discrimination against persons and against places
to arise from daily fluctuation in rates is guarded against by
requiring publication of rates and forbidding changes of the
published rates, whether by way of increase or reduction
during a limited time. To hold, then, the contract under con-
sideration to be invalid when it simply provides for uniform
classification, and seeks to prevent secret or sudden changes
in the published rates, would be to avoid a contract covered
by the law and embodied in its policy. It cannot, I think, be
correctly said that whilst the avowed purpose of the contract
in question embraced only the foregoing objects, its ulterior
intent was to bring about results in conflict with the inter-
state commerce law. The answers to the bill of complaint
specially denied the allegations as to the improper motives of
the parties to the contract, and also expressly averred their
lawful and innocent intention. As the case was heard upon
bill and answer, improper motives cannot therefore be im-
puted. Indeed, the opinion of the court sustains this view,
since it eliminates all consideration of improper motives and
holds that the validity of the contract must depend upon its
face, and deduces as a legal. conclusion from this premise that
the contract is invalid, because even reasonable contracts are
embraced within the purview of the act of 1890. To my
mind, the judicial declaration that carriers cannot agree
among themselves for the purpose of aiding. in the enforce-
ment of the provisions of the interstate commerce law, will
strike a blow at the beneficial results of that act, and will
have a direct tendency to produce the preferences and dis-
criminations which it was one of the main objects of the act
to frustrate. The great complexity of the subject, the nu-
merous interests concerned in it, the vast area over which it

operates, present difficulties enough without, it seems to me,
its being advisable to add to them by holding that a contract
which is supported by the text of the law is invalid, because,
although it is reasonable and just, it must be considered as in
restraint of trade.
Nor, do I think that the danger of these evil consequences
is avoided by the statement that if the contract be annulled,
these dangers will not arise, because experience shows that
contracts such as that here in question, when entered into
by railroads, are never observed, and therefore it is just as
though the contract did not exist. How, may I ask, can
judicial notice be taken of this fact, when it is said that
judicial notice cannot be taken of the fact that there are such
contracts? How, moreover, may I ask, can it be said on one
branch of the case that the contract, although reasonable,
must be avoided, because it is a contract in restraint of trade,
and then on the other branch declared that contracts of that
character never do restrain trade' because they are never
carried out between the parties who enter into them?
There is another contention which, I submit, is also un-
sound, that is the suggestion that it is impossible to say that
there can be such a thing as a reasonable contract between
railroads seeking to avoid sudden or secret changes in reason-
able rates because the question of railroad rates is so complex
and is involved in so much difficulty that to say that a rate is
reasonable is equivalent to saying that it must be fixed by
the railroads themselves, as no mind outside of the officials of
the particular roads can determine whether a rate is reason-
able or not. But this proposition absolutely conflicts with the
methods of dealing with railroad rates adopted in England
and expressly put in force by Congress in the Interstate Com-
merce Act and by many, of the States of the Union. For
years, the rule in England was reasonable rates enforced by
judicial power, and subsequently by enactment securing such
reasonable rates by administrative authority. The Interstate
Commerce Act especially provides for reasonable rates, and
vests primarily in the commission, and -then in the courts the
power to enforce the provision and like machinery is provided

in many of the States. Will it be said that Congress and
other legislative bodies have provided for reasonable rates and
created the machinery to enforce them, when whether rates
are reasonable or not is impossible of ascertainment? If this
proposition be correct, what, may I ask, becomes of the judg-
ment of this court in Cincinnati,N ew Orleans &c. Railway
Co. v, Interstate Commerce Commission, 162 U. S. 184, where
it is held that the order of the commission finding certain
rates charged by a railroad to be unreasonable was correct?
In conclusion, I notice briefly the proposition that though it
be admitted that contracts, when made by individuals or pri-
vate corporations, when reasonable, will not be considered as
in restraint of trade, yet such is not the case as to public cor-
porations, because any contract made by them in any measure
in restraint of trade, even when reasonable, is presumptively
injurious to the public interests, and therefore invalid. The
fallacy in this proposition consists in overlooking the distinc-
tion between acts of a public corporation which are ultra vires
and those which are not. If the contract of such a corpora-
tion which is assailed be ultra vires, of course the question of
reasonableness becomes irrelevant, since the charter is the rea-
son of the being of the corporation. The doctrine is predicated
on the following expressions taken from the opinion of the
court expressed by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller in Gibbs v. Balti-
more Gas Co., 130 U. S. 396, 408:
"That in the instance of business of such a character that
it presumably cannot be restrained to any extent whatever
without prejudice to the public interests, courts decline to
enforce or sustain contracts imposing such restraint, however
partial, because in contravention of public policy. This sub-
ject is much considered, and the authorities cited in West Vir-
ginia Transportation Cb. v. Ohio River Pipe -Line Co., 22
West Va. 600; Chicago &c. Gas Co. v. People's Gas Co., 121
Illinois, 530; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. American
Union Telegraph Co., 65 Georgia, 160."
But, manifestly, this language must be construed with refer-
ence to the facts of the case in which it was used. What the
facts were in that case is shown by the statement in the
