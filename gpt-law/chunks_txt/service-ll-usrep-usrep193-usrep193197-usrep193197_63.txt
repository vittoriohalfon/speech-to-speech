state railroad corporations, because they did in part an inter-
state commerce business, was within the paramount authority
of Congress, that authority was exclusive and the state regu-
lation which the court upheld was void. And this question,
vital to the consideration of the case, and without passing
upon which it could not have been decided did not escape
observation, since it was explicitly pressed upon the court and
was directly determined. The court, speaking through Mr.
Justice Brown, said (pp. 701, 702):
"But little need be said in answer to the final contention of
the plaintiff in error, that the assumption of a right to forbid
the consolidation of parallel and competing lines is an inter-
ference with the power of Congress over interstate commerce.
The same remark may be made with respect to all police regu-
lations of interstate railways.
"It has never been supposed that the dominant power of
Congress over interstate commerce took from the States the
power of legislation with respect to the instruments of such
commerce, so far as the legislation was within its ordinary
police powers. Nearly all the railways in the country have
been constructed under state authority, and it cannot be
supposed that they intended to abandon their power over them
as soon as they were finished. The power to construct them
involves necessarily the power to impose such regulations
upon their operation as a sound regard for the interests of the
public may seem to render desirable. In the division of au-
thority with respect to interstate railways Congress reserves
to itself the superior right to control their commerce and forbid
interference therewith; while to the States remains the power
to create and to regulate the instruments of such commerce,
so far as necessary to the conservation of the public inter-
ests."
How one case could be more completely decisive of another
than the ruling in the case just quoted is of this I am un,%bl

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
WHITE, J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, PECKHaM, HOLMES, JJ., dissenting. 193 U. S.
The subject was considered at circuit in In re Greene, 52
Fed. Rep. 104. The case was this: A person was indicted in
one State for creating a monopoly in violation of the Anti-
Trust Act of Congress and was held in another State for extra-
dition. The writ of habeas corpus was invoked, upon the
contention that the face of the indictment did not state an
offense against the United States, since the matters charged
did not involve interstate commerce. The case is referred to,
although it arose at circuit and was determined before the
decisions of this court in the Pearsall and Louisville and Nash-
ville cases, because it was decided by Mr. Justice Jackson, then
a Circuit Judge, who subsequently, became a member of this
court. The opinion manifests that the case was considered
by Judge Jackson with that care which was his conceded
characteristic and was stated by him with that lucidity which
was his wont. In discharging the accused on the grounds
stated in the application for the writ, Judge Jackson said
(p. 112):
"Congress may place restrictions and limitations upon the
right of corporations created and organized under its authority
to acquire, use and dispose of property. It may also impose
such restrictions and limitations upon the citizen in respect to
the exercise of a public privilege or franchise conferred by the
United States. But Congress certainly has not the power or
authority under the commerce clause, or any other provision
of the Constitution, to limit and restrict the right of corpora-
tions created by the States, or the citizens of the States, in the
acquisition, control and disposition of property. Neither can
Congress regulate or prescribe the price or prices at which such
property, or products thereof, shall be sold by the owner or
owners, whether corporations or individuals. It is equally
clear that Congress has no jurisdiction over, and cannot make
criminal, the aims, purposes and intentions of persons in the
acquisition and control of property, which the States of their
residence or creation sanction and permit. It is not material
that such property, or the products thereof, may become the

subject of trade or commerce among the several States or with
foreign nations. Commerce among the States, within the
exclusive regulating power of Congress, 'consists of intercourse
and traffic between their citizens, and includes the transporta-
tion of persons and property, as well as the purchase, sale and
exchange of commodities.' County of Mobile v. Kimball, 102
U. S. 691, 702; Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, 114 U. S.
203. In the application of this comprehensive definition, it
is settled by the decision of the Supreme Court that such
commerce includes, not only the actual transportation of com-
modities and persons between the States, but also the instru-
mentalities and processes of such transportation.
"That neither the production or manufacture of articles or
commodities which constitute subjects of commerce, and which
are intended for trade and traffic with citizens of other States,
nor the preparation for their transportation from the State
where produced or manufactured, prior to the commencement
of the actual transfer, or transmission thereof to another State,
constitutes that interstate commerce which comes within the
regulating power of Congress; and, further, that after the ter-
mination of the transportation of commodities or articles of
traffic from one State to another, and the mingling or merging
thereof in the general mass of property in the State of destina-
tion, the sale, distribution and consumption thereof in the.
latter State forms no part of interstate commerce."
If this opinion had been written in the case now considered
it could not more completely than its reasoning does have dis-
posed of the contention that the ownership of stock by a cor-
poration in competing railroads was commerce.
United States v. Freight Association, 166 U. S. 290, was this:
A large number of railway companies, who were made defend-
ants in the cause, had formed themselves into an association,
known as the Trans-Missouri Freight Association, and the
companies had bound themselves by the provisions contained
in the articles of agreement. Many stipulations relating to
