Statement of the Case.
will pay the established charges of that company for its ser-
vices, and that in point of fact, a very large part of the busi-
ness done at said yards is transacted by persons who are not
members of the exchange, and without the interposition of
such members. It is also alleged in their answer that they
are under no obligations to extend the privileges of the ex-
change to a person who is not a member thereof, who has
violated its rules and been suspended from'membership, and
who has voluntarily withdrawn therefrom, and announced his
purpose to carry on his business as a competitor of the mem-
bers of such exchange, to the destruction of said organization
and its rules and to the injury of his competitors.
It is also set up that defendants cannot be compelled to deal
with a non-member of their organization, or a person violat-
ing its rules, or with one who has been suspended for such
violation, or who has withdraivn therefrom, or who has an-
nounced his intention to destroy said organization and to
compete with the members thereof, and the defendants allege
that they cannot be compelled to deal with any person what-
soever, and that they had'a right to establish, said exchange,
and now have the right to maintain the same, and to require
the observance of its rules and regulations on the part of their
associates, so long as they desire to retain the privileges of
membership in the body. They allege that their rules are in
harmony with the rules and regulations of commercial ex-
changes which have existed for more than a hundred years,
and which are now to be found in every State almost in the
United States, and throughout the world, and that such rule3
and regulations are in all respects legal and binding. They
deny all general and special allegations of illegal agreements,
combinations or conspiracies to violate any la'w of the United
States, or of the State of Kansas.
The complainants, in addition to their bill, used several
affidavits, the tendency of which was to show that by virtue
of the adoption of rules 9 and 16, the members of the ex-
change refused to deal with one who had violated a rule and
had been suspended by reason thereof, and that by reason of
this refusal to do business, the member thus suspended was

substantially incapacitated from carrying on his business as a
commission merchant, and that by this combination defend-
ants, in forming such rule and in adhering to it, have greatly
injured the business of such member.
The defendants read counter-affidavits for the. purpose of
sustaining their answer, which were replied to by the coin-
plainants filing affidavits in rebuttal, and .upon these affidavis
and the pleadings above described an application for an in-
junction was made to the Circuit Court of the United States
for the District of Kansas, First Division. That court, after
argument, granted an injunction restraining the defendants
from combining by contract, express or implied, so as by their
acts, conduct or words to interfere with, hinder or impede
others in shipping, trading, selling or buying live stock that
is received from the States and Territories at the stock yards
in Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas; also
-enjoining them from acting under the rules of the exchange
known as rules 9 and 16, and from attempting to impose any
fines or penalties upon members for trading or offering to
trade with any. person respecting the purchase and sale of
any live stock; and also from discriminating in favor of any
member of the exchange because of such membership, and
-especially from discriminating against any person trading at
the stock yards, and from refusing, by united or concerted
action, or by word, persuasion, threat or by other means, to
,deal or trade with persons with respect to such live stock who
.are not members of the association, because they are not
members of such association, or in any manner from interfer-
ing with the right and freedom of all and any persons trading
,or desiring to trade in such live stock at the stock yards, the
same as if the exchange did not exist. The defendants were
also enjoined from agreeing or attempting tolimit the right
of any person in business at the Kansas City stock yards to
employ labor or assistance in soliciting shipments of live stock
from other States or Territories, and from enforcing any agree-
ment not to send prepaid telegrams from the stock yards to
any other State or Territory.

injunction, which will be found reported in 82 Fed. Rep. 529.
From the order granting it an appeal was taken by the defend-
ants to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit, which court certified to this court certain ques-
tions under the provisions of section 6 of the act of March 3,
1891, and thereupon a writ of certiorari was issued from this
court, and the whole case brought here for decision.

Mr. Samuel W. Moore for the Uniteal Stktes" Mr. Solicitor
General was on his brief.
MR. JUSTInCE PECKHAM, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
The relief sought in this case is based exclusively on the act
of Congress approved July 2, 1890, c. 647, entitled "An act
to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and
monopolies," commonly spoken of as the Anti-Trust act. 26
Stat. 209.
The act has reference only to that trade or commerce which
exists, or may exist, among the several States or with foreign
nations, and has no application whatever to any other trade
or commerce.
The question meeting us at the threshold, therefore, in this
case is, what is the nature of the business of the defendants,
and ar6 the by-laws-, or any subdivision of them above referred
to, in their direct effect in restraint of' trade or commerce
among the several States or with foreign nations; or does the
case made by the bill and answer show that any one of the
above defendants has monopolized, or attempted to monop-
olize, or combined or conspired with othier persons to monop-
olize, any part of the trade or commerce among the several
States or with foreign nations?
