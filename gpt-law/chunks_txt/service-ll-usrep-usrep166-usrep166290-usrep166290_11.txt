roads. Whether these complaints were well or ill founded we
do not presume at this time and under these circumstances to
determine or to discuss. It is simply for the purpose of
answering the statement that it was only to trusts of the
nature above set forth that this legislation was directed, that
the subject of the opinions of the people in regard to the
actions of the railroad companies in this particular is referred
to. A reference to this history of the times does not, as we
think, furnish us with any strong reason for believing that it
was only trusts that were in the minds of the members of
Congress, and that railroads and their manner of doing busi-
ness were wholly excluded therefrom.
Our attention is also called to one of the rules for the con-
struction of statutes which has been approved by this court;
that while it is the duty of courts to ascertain the meaning of
the legislature from the words used ih the statute and the
subject-matter to which it relates, there is an equal duty to
restrict the meaning of general words, whenever it is found
necessary to do so in order to carry out the legislative intent.
Brewer v. Blougher, 14 Pet. 178, 198; Petri v. Commercial
Bank of Chicago, 142 U. S. 644, 650; Mc~ee v. United States,
164 U. S. 287. It is therefore urged that if, by a strict con-
struction of the language of this statute it may be made to
include railroads, yet it is evident from other considerations
now to be mentioned that the real meaning of the legislature
would not include them, and they must for that reason be
excluded. It is said that this meaning is plainly to be inferred,
because of fundamental differences both in an economic way
and before the law between trade and manufacture on the one
hand, and railroad transportation on the other. Among these
differences are the public character of railroad business, and
as a result the peculiar power of control and regulation pos-
sessed by the State over railroad companies. The trader or
manufacturer, on the other hand, carries on an entirely pri-
vate business, and can sell to whom he pleases; he may
charge different prices for the same article to different
individuals; he may charge as much as he can get for the
article in which he deals, whether the price be reasonable or

unreasonable; he may make such discrimination in his busi-
ness as he chooses, and he may cease to do any business when-
ever his choice lies in that direction ; while, on the contrary,
a railroad company must transport all persons and property
that come to it, and it must do so at the same price for the
same service, and the price must be reasonable, and it cannot
at its will discontinue its business. It is also urged that there
are evils arising from unrestricted competition in regard to
railroads which do not exist in regard to any other kind of
property, that it is so admitted by the latest and best writers
on the subject, and that practical experience of the results of
unrestricted competition among railroads tends directly to the
same view; that the difference between railroad property on
the one hand, and all other kinds of property on the other
hand, is so plain that entirely different economic results follow
from unrestricted competition among railroads from those
which obtain in regard to all other kinds of business. It is
also said that the contemporaneous industrial history of the
country, the legal situation in regard to railroad properties at
the time of the enactment of this statute, its legislative history,
the ancient and constantly maintained different legal effect
and policy regarding railway transportation and ordinary
trade and manufacture, together with a just regard for inter-
ests of such enormous magnitude as are represented by the
railroads of the country, all tend to show that Congress in
passing the Anti-Trust Act never could have contemplated
the inclusion of railroads within its provisions. It is, there-
fore, claimed to be the duty of the court, in carrying out the
rule of statutory construction, above stated, to restrict the
meaning of these general words of the statute which would
include railroads, because, from the considerations above men-
tioned, it is plain that Congress never intended that railroads
should be included.
Many of the foregoing assertions may be well founded,
while at the same time the correctness of the conclusions
sought to be drawn therefrom need not be conceded. The
points of difference between the railroad and other corpora-
tions are many and great. It cannot be disputed that a railroad

is a public corporation, and its business pertains to and greatly
affects the public, and that it is of a public nature. The com-
pany may not charge unreasonable prices for transportation,
nor can it make unjust discriminations, nor select its patrons,
nor go out of business when it chooses, while a mere trading
or manufacturing company may do all these things. But
the very fact of the public character of a railroad would itself
seem to call for special care by the legislature in regard to
its conduct, so that its business should be carried on with as
much reference to the proper and fair interests of the public
as possible. While the points of difference just mentioned
and others do exist between the two classes of corporations,
it must be remembered they have also some points of
resemblance. Trading, manufacturing and railroad corpora-
tions are all engaged in the transaction of business with re-
gard to articles of trade and commerce, each in its special
sphere, either in manufacturing or trading in commodities
or in their transportation by rail. A contract among those
engaged in the latter business by which the prices for the
transportation of commodities traded in or manufactured by
the others is greatly enhanced from what it otherwise would
be if free competition were the rule, affects and to a certain
extent restricts trade and commerce, and affects the price of
the commodity. Of this there can be no question. Manu-
facturing or trading companies may also affect prices by join-
ing together in forming a trust or.other combination, and by
making agreements in restraint of trade and commerce, which
when carried out affect the interests of the public. Why
should not a railroad company be included in general legisla-
tion aimed at the prevention of that kind of agreement made
in restraint of trade, which may exist in all companies, which
is substantially of the same nature wherever found, and which
tends very much towards the same results, whether put in
practice by a trading and manufacturing or by a railroad
company? It is true the results of trusts, or combinations
of that nature, may be different in different kinds of corpora-
tions, and yet they all have an essential similarity, and have
been induced by motives of individual or corporate aggran-
