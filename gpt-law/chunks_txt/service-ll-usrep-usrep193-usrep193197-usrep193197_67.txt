of the exertion of the lawful power, it cannot be said, without
a contradiction in terms, that the power exercised is a regula-
tion, because a direct burden upon commerce. To say to the
contrary would be to declare that no power on any subject, however
local in its character, could be exercised by the States if it was
deemed by Congress or the courts that there would be produced
some effect upon interstate commerce. The question whether a
burden is direct and therefore constitutes a regulation of inter-
state commerce is to be determined by ascertaining whether
the power exerted is lawful, generally speaking, and then by
finding whether its exercise in the particular case was such as
to cause it to be illegal, because directly burdening interstate
commerce. If in a given case the power be lawful and the
mode in which it is exercised be not such as to directly burden,
there is no regulation of commerce, although as an indirect
result of the exertion of the lawful power some effect may be
produced upon commerce. In other words, where the power
is lawful but it is asserted that it has been so exerted as to
amount to a direct burden, there must be, so to speak, a privity
between the manifestation of the power and the resulting burden.
The distinction is well illustrated by the cases which have
been referred to, and was very lucidly pointed out by Judge
Jackson in the Greene case. Take the Knight case. There as
the contract merely concerned the purchase of stock in the
refineries, and contained no condition relating to the movement
in interstate commerce of the goods to be manufactured by the
refining companies, the court held as the right to acquire was
not within the commerce clause, the fact that the owners of
the manufactured product might thereafter so act concerning
the product as to burden commerce, there was no direct burden
resulting from the mere acquisition and ownership. On the
contrary, in the Addyston Pipe case, after stating in the fullest
way the paramount authority of Congress concerning com-
merce, the court approached the terms of the contract in order
to determine whether it related to interstate commerce, and if
it did, whether it created a direct burden. In doing so, as it

found that the contract both related to interstate commerce
and directly burdened the same, the contract was held to be
void. This case comes within the Knight case. It concerns
the acquisition and ownership of stock. No contract is in
question made by the owners of the stock controlling the rail-
roads in the performance of their duties as carriers of interstate
commerce. The sole contention is that as the result of the
ownership of the stock there may arise, in the operation of the
roads, a burden on interstate commerce. That is, that such
burden may indirectly result from the acquisition and owner-
ship. To maintain the contention, therefore, it must be
decided that because ownership of property if acquired may
be so used as to burden commerce, therefore to acquire and
own is to burden. This, however, would be but to declare that
that which was in its very nature and essence indirect is direct.
3. But, it is said, it may not be denied that the common
ownership of stock in competing railroads endows the holders
of the majority of the stock with a common interest in both
railroads and with the authority, if they choose to exert it, to
so unify the management of the roads as to suppress competi-
tion between them. This power, it is insisted, is within the
regulating authority of Congress over interstate commerce.
In other words, the contention broadly is that Congress has not
only the authority to regulate the exercise of interstate com-
merce, but under that power has the right to regulate the
ownership and possession of property, if the enjoyment of such
rights would enable those who possessed them if they engaged
in interstate commerce to exert a power over the same. But
this proposition only asserts in another form that the right to
acquire the stock was interstate commerce, and therefore was
within the authority of Congress, and is refuted by the reasons
and authorities already advanced. That the proposition, if
adopted, would extend the power of Congress to all subjects
essentially local, as already stated in considering the previous
proposition, is to my mind manifest. So clearly is this the
result of the particular proposition now being considered, that,

at the risk of repetition, I again illustrate the subject. Under
this doctrine the sum of property to be acquired by individuals
or by corporations, the contracts which they may make, would
be within the regulating power of Congress. If it were judged
by Congress that the farmer in sowing his crops should be
limited to a certain production because overproduction would
give power to affect commerce, Congress could regulate that
subject. If the acquisition of a large amount of property by
an individual was deemed by Congress to confer upon him
the power to affect interstate commerce if he engaged in it,
Congress could regulate that subject. If the wage-earner
organized to better his condition and Congress believed that
the existence of such organization would give power, if it were
exerted, to affect interstate commerce, Congress could forbid
the organization of all labor associations. Indeed, the doctrine
must in reason lead to a concession of the right in Congress to
regulate concerning the aptitude, the character and capacity.
of persons. If individuals were deemed by Congress to be
possessed of such ability that participation in the management
of two great competing, railroad enterprises would endow them
with the power to injuriously affect interstate commerce, Con-
gress could forbid such participation. If the principle were
adopted, and the power which would arise from so doing were
exercised, the result would be not only to destroy the state and
Federal governments, but by the implication of authority, from
which the destruction would be brought about, there would be
erected upon the ruins of both a government endowed with the
arbitrary power to disregard the great guaranty of life, liberty
and property and every other safeguard upon which organized
civil society depends. I say the guaranty, because in my
opinion the three are indissolubly united, and one cannot be
destroyed without the other. Of course, to push propositions
to the extreme to which they naturally lead is often an unsafe
guide. But at the same time the conviction cannot be escaped
by me that principles and conduct bear a relation one to the
other, especially in matters of public concern. The fathers
