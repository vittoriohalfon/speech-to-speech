Statement of the Case.
actually dissolved and its existence ended on the above date,
November 19, 1892, and that it has not since that date been
revived, nor has it since that date had any activity of any
kind, "and that it has not conducted or been engaged in any
operations or business whatever, but that it has been dead and
out of existence."
It also alleged as another ground for dismissing the appeal
that the matter in controversy does not exceed $1000, and that
the case does not come under any other provision of the act of
1891, allowing an appeal from the Circuit Courts of Appeals
to this court. In opposition to the motion it appeared upon
the part of the appellant that at the same meeting at which
the resolution above referred to was adopted, the foll6wing
resolution was also adopted: "Resolved, That a committee of
seven be appointed by the chairman of this meeting to draw up
a new agreement for the conduct of business now substantially
covered by the Trans-Missouri agreement and to make a report
to all lines in the Trans-Missouri Association at a meeting
to be called in Chicago on December 6, 1892." A committee
of seven was accordingly appointed, which adopted a resolution
calling a meeting for the 6th of December, 1892, of the lines
formerly members of the Trans-Missouri Association and rep-
resentatives of other interested lines for the purpose of con-
sidering any changes in the tariffs and of business which was
under the jurisdiction of that association and which might be
submitted to the parties at that time, and to further consider
the organization of one or more rate committees to govern
the manner of making rates on such traffic until some per-
manent organization could be effected. In the early days
of December, 1892, the meeting so called was held and was
participated in by most of the railroad companies which were
parties to the Trans-Missouri agreement, and at that meeting
an agreement was made upon the subject of rates of freight,
and a West-Missouri freight rate committee was appointed,
the duties of which committee were to establish and maintain
reasonable rates in the territory described, and other lines not
therein represented but interested in the freight traffic of such
territory were to be invited to become members. A plan for

Counsel for Parties.
the establishment of sub-rate committees for the purpose of
agreeing upon rates was therein set forth and agreed to. The
agreement was to become effective on the 1st of January, 1892,
and to remain in force until the following April, during which
time it was supposed that a new and permanent association to
provide for an agreement relating to rates of freight might be
founded. It does not appear whether such permanent asso-
ciation has been formed or that the temporary agreement has
been actually terminated.
In answer to the motion to dismiss on the ground that the
matter in controversy did not amount to over a thousand
dollars, the parties have stipulated as follows: "It is hereby
stipulfted for the purposes of this case and no other, and
without waiving any right to question the legal effect of such
fact, that the daily freight charges on interstate shipments
collected by all the railway companies at points where they
compete with each other were, at the time of the agreement
mentioned in the pleadings herein, and have been since, more
than one thousand dollars."
To the motion made to dismiss the appeal for want of juris-
diction, briefs were filed as follows:
fr. W. .Guthrie filed a brief on behalf of the Burlington
and Missouri River Railroad Company in support of the
motion.
Mr.L loyd W. Bowers filed a brief on behalf of the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa F6 Railroad Company, the Chicago, Rock
Island and Pacific Railroad Company, the Fremont, Elkhorn
and Missouri Valley Railroad Company, The Sioux City
and Pacific Railroad Company and the Chicago, St. Paul,
Minneapolis and Omaha Railway Company in support of the
motion.
Mr.A ttorney General and Mr.A ssistant Attorney General
Whitney for the United States filed a brief opposing the
motion.

M r. Lloyd W. Bowers filed a brief for the Fremont, Elkhorn
and Missouri Valley Railroad Company and the Sioux City
and Pacific Railroad Company.
MR. JUSTICE PECKEAm, after stating the facts, delivered the
opinion of the court.
The defendants object to the hearing of this appeal, and
ask that it be dismissed on the ground that the Trans-Missouri
Freight Association has been dissolved by a vote of its members
since the judgment entered in this suit in the court below. A
further ground urged for the dismissal of the appeal is that
the requisite amount (over one thousand dollars) is not in con-
troversy in the suit, and that as an appeal would only lie to
this court in this character of suit under the act of March 3,
1891, c. 517, 28 Stat. 826, where that amount is in controversy,
the appeal should be dismissed.
As to the first ground, we think the fact of the dissolution
of the association does not prevent this court from taking cog-
nizance of the appeal and deciding the case upon its merits.
