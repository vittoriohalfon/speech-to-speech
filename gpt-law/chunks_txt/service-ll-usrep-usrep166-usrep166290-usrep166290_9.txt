fore, would it follow that the sixth section should provide
for the forfeiture of the property of the carrier if the rest
of the act were intended to apply to it? To subject the
locomotives and cars to forfeiture under such circumstances
might also cause great confusion to the general business of
the carrier and in that way inflict unmerited punishment
upon the inuocent owners of other property in the course
of transportation in the same cars and drawn by the same
locomotives. If the company itself violates the act, the
penalties are sufficient as provided for therein.
But it is maintained that an agreement like the one in ques-
tion on the part of the railroad companies is authorized by
the Commerce Act, which is a special statute applicable only
to railroads, and that a construction of the Trust Act (which
is a general act) so as to include within its provisions the case
of railroads, carries with it the repeal by implication of so
much of the Commerce Act as authorized the agreement.
It is added that there is no language in the Trust Act which
is sufficiently plain to indicate a purpose to repeal those pro-
visions of the Commerce Act which permit the agreement;
that both acts may stand, the special or Commerce Act as
relating solely to railroads and their proper regulation and
management, while the later and general act will apply to
all contracts of the nature therein described, entered into
by any one other than competing common carriers by rail-
road for the purpose of establishing rates of traffic for trans-
portation. On a line with this reasoning it is said that if
Congress had intended to in any manner. affect the railroad
carrier as governed by the Commerce Act, it would have
amended that act directly and in terms, and not have left
it as a question of construction to be determined whether
so important a change in the commerce statute had been ac-
complished by the passage of the statute relating to trusts.
The first answer to this argument is that, in our opinion,
the Commerce Act does not authorize an agreement of this
nature. It may not in terms prohibit, but it is far from
conferring either directly or by implication any authority
to make it. If the agreement be legal it does not owe its

validity to any provision of the Commerce Act, and if ille-
gal it is not made so by that act. The fifth section prohibits
what is termed "pooling," but there is no express provision
in the act prohibiting the maintenance of traffic rates among
competing roads by making such an agreement as this, nor is
there L v provision which permits it. Prior to the passage of
the act the companies had sometimes endeavored to regulate
competition and to maintain rates by pooling arrangements,
and in the act that kind of an arrangement was forbidden.
After its passage other devices were resorted to for the pur-
pose of curbing competition and maintaining rates. The
general nature of a contract like the one before us is not
mentioned in or provided for by the act. The provisions of
that act look to the prevention of discrimination, to the fur-
nishing of equal facilities for the interchange of traffic, to the
rate of compensation for what is termed the long and the
short haul, to the attainment of a continuous passage from
the point of shipment to the point of destination, at a known
and published schedule, and, in the language of counsel for
defendants, " without reference to the location of those points
or the lines over which it is necessary for the traffic to pass,"
to procuring uniformity of rates charged by each company to
its patrons, and to other objects of a similar nature. The act
was not directed to the securing of uniformity of rates to be
charged by competing companies, nor was there any provision
therein as to a maximum oe minimum of rates. Competing
and non-connecting roads are not authorized by this statute
to make an agreement like this one.
As the Commerce Act does not authorize this agreement,
argument against a repeal by implication, of the provisions
of the act which it is alleged grant such authority, becomes
ineffective. There is no repeal in the case, and both statutes
may stand, as neither is inconsistent with the other.
It is plain, also, that an amendment of the Commerce Act
would not be an appropriate method of enacting the legis-
lation contained in the Trust Act, for the reason that the
latter act includes other subjects in addition to the contracts
of or combinations among railroads, and is addressed to the

prohibition of other contracts besides those relating to trans-
portation. The omission, therefore, to amend the Commerce
Act furnishes no reason for claiming that the later statute
does not apply to railroad transportation. Although the
commerce statute may be described as a general code for
the regulation and government of railroads upon the subjects
treated of therein, it cannot be contended that it furnishes
a complete and perfect set of rules and regulations which
are to govern them in all cases, and that any subsequent act
in relation to them must, when passed, in effect amend or
repeal some provision of that statute. The statute does not
cover all cases concerning transportation by railroad and all
contracts relating thereto. It does not purport to cover such
an extensive field.
The existence of agreements similar to this one may-have
been known to Congress at the time it passed the Commerce
Act, although we are not aware, from the record, that an
agreement of this kind had ever been made and publicly
known prior to the passage of the Commerce Act. Yet if it
had been known to Congress, its omission to prohibit it at
that time, while prohibiting the pooling arrangements, is
no reason for assuming that when passing the Trust Act
it meant to except all contracts of railroad companies in re-
gard to traffic rates from the operation of such act. Congress
for its own reasons, even if aware of the existence of such
agreements, did not see fit when it passed the Commerce Act
to prohibit them with regard to railroad companies alone, and
the act was not an appropriate place for general legislation on
the subject. And at that time, and for several years there-
after, Congress did not think proper to legislate upon the
subject at all. Finally it passed this Trust Act, and in our
opinion no obstacle to its application to contracts relating to
transportation by railroads is to be found in the fact that
the Commerce Act had been passed several years before, in
which the entering into such agreements was not in terms
prohibited.
It is also urged that the debates in Congress show beyond a
doubt that the act as passed does not include railroads. Coun-
