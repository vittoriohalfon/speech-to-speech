to which he released and waived all claim to an equitable lien
upon the said sum of $125,000 so collected and held by him, and
he was also to pay to the complainant and discharge the coupons
upon such $90,000 of bonds.
The formal order denying the .motion for a receiver was filed
September 7, 1896. Considerable testimony was taken in -the
case subsequently to that time upon the various issues made by
the pleadings, but the trial had not been conoluded, when on
April 12, 1898, a fire occurred, by reason of which, as claimed
on the part of the mortgagee, the greater part of its security
was destroyed. A supplemental bill was then filed by complain-
ant by leave of court, and various insurance companies which
had insured the property for The Penn Company were brought
in as parties to the suit, and the bomplainant demanded, in ad-
dition to the relief which was prayed for in the original bill, a
decree providing that the complainant should have a first lien
on the insurance moneys paid or to be paid under such policies
for the purpose of paying the bondholders holding the $90,000
of bonds as above mentioned, any balance which might be due
them after the sale of the mortgaged premises should be made,
if such sale should result in any deficiency in the payment of
those bonds.
Testimony was taken relative to the averments contained in
the supplemental bill. It was proved on behalf of The Penn
Company that since Kann and The Penn Company had the title
to and possession of the property, there had been spent by them
upon the property, by w.ay of repairs and improvements, between
$180,000 and $200,000.
The decree of the Circuit Court, after providing for the fore-
closure and sale of the mortgaged premises, made specific pro-
vision for the application of the insurance moneys in the hands
of Wertheimer to the payment of any deficiency that might
arise, after applying the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged
property to the payment of the bonds medtioned in the decree.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
YR. JUSTICE PEOKHAx, after making the foregoing statement
of facts, delivered the opinion of the court.
The only question involved in this case arises from the pro-
vision made in the decree by the Circuit Court Judge, impress-
ing what is termed an equitable lien upon the insurance moneys
collected on the policies taken out by The Penn Company, suf-
ficient to pay any balance which may remain unpaid on the
bonds secured by the mortgage to complainant, after the appli-
cation of the proceeds of the sale of the property mortgaged.
The Circuit Court held that the complainant had such equitable
lien, while the Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Acheson dis-
senting, was of the contrary opinion, and therefore reversed
that portion of the decree which provided for it.
The policies upon which the moneys were collected to pay
the loss happening by fire, were taken out by The Penn Com-
pany for the purpose of covering its own interest in the prop-
erty, and the language of the policies covered such interest
only. There was no contract in the policies covering the in-
terest of the complainant as mortgagee, nor was the insurance,
in fact, effected for the purpose of carrying out any agreement
or obligation on the part of The Penn Company with the com-
plainant to effect insutance covering the interest of the bond-
holders. On the contrary, this purpose was disaffirmed and
the obligation denied. The Penn Company had the right to
insure its own interest, and unless there was some contractual
obligation on its part on the subject, which bound it, or some
conduct on its part, or on the part of Kann, its immediate
grantor, which would estop it from setting up the fact that it
had procured the insurance for itself, the moneys arising out
of the contracts which it made with the various insurance con-
panies, cannot be taken from it and bestowed on the complain-
ant for the benefit of the bondholders secured by the mortgage
in suit. Some obligation of the defendant of a contractual na-
ture must exist, or some conduct must be proved, estopping
the defendant from denying such obligation, before the court
can be authorized to take such moneys and bestow them upon
the mortgagee for the benefit of the bondholders.

FARMERUS' LOAN &c. CO. v. PENN PLATE GLASS CO. 445
Opinion of the Court.
The complainant asserts that, without regard to 'any -pro--
vision in the mortgage, it has an equitable lien upon The Penn
Company's insurance, and that, under the circumstances, such
company must be treated as in the position of a receiverap-
pointed on complainant's motion in this'case. The peculiar
circumstances uponwhioh the claim is based tbat defendants
should be so treated, seem principally to be the denial of com-
plainant's motion for the appointment of a receiver at the time
of the commencement of this suit to foreclose the mortgage,
and the fact that The Penn Company had insurance on the
property. The denial of the motion for a receiver, it is
averred, was brought about by the. opposition of the defend-
ants Kann and The Penn Company, and it is argued that they
ought not to have opposed the motion, and their opposition
was improper and in bad faith. But it must be remembered
they were parties to the suit, and in the legal protection of
their rights it was perfectly proper for them to oppose, before
the court, the appointment of a receiver, even though their op-
position secured the denial of the complainant's motion. We
see nothing upon which to base an accusation of bad faith ii
this conduct of defendants. The complainant, however, re-
gards the application for a receiver as the sanrre in substance
as an application to take possession of the pfemises in pur-
suance of the provisions of the mortgage, consequent upon a
default in the payment of the principal or interest of the bonds ,
or because of a violation of any other of the covenants con-
tained in such mortgage. Even if that. be so, we see nothing
in such fact to in any way alter the right of defendants to op-
pose by argument before the court the appointment of a re-
ceiver. There is :no pretence that they made any allegatiopr
upon the hearing which were untrue-or that their opposition-
was based upon anything other than conceded facts. Possibly
the Circuit Court ought to have appointed a receiver ulion the
application of the complainant. That was a matter resting a
good deal in its sound discretion. The Penn Company and
Kann were, however, entirely wvithin their legal rights when
they opposed such application, and we are unable to see that
their conduct in so doing in any manner altered those rights
