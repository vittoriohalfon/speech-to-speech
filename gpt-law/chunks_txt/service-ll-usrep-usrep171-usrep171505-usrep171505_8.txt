OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Mr. Carter's Argument for The Joint Traffic Association.
(15) Under general subdivision V the conclusion to which
the foregoing line of argument leads is drawn in these words:
"That the agreement which this action seeks to condemn is
not by reason of any restraint effected by it upon competi-
tion, or otherwise, a contract in restraint of trade or coma
merce, but is on the contrary highly needful to, and promotive
of, both."
Its necessity to beneficial purposes, as thus established, is
then separaiely pointed out by way of summing up: (a) Its
necessity to stability in rates. (b) Its necessity to uniformity
in rates and to prevent uiijust discrimination. (o) Its necessity
to secure the general benefits of harmonious cooperation in
classification and interchange of traffic. (d) Its necessity
as a supplement to the Interstate Commerce act, and in order
to make the objects of that act attainable. (e) Its necessity
for the prevention of crime, for its punishment, when com-
mitted, and for the prevention of perjury, committed in order
to, conceal crime.
VI. If the Anti-Trust act is interpreted as forbidding agree-
ments, such as the one under discussion, one of three alternatives
must necessarily follow.. (1) That all railroad transportation
be abandoned; or, (2) The consolidation of all competing
railroads under a single ownership, either governmental or
private; or, (3) That all competing railroad business must
be carried on in constant and daily violation of criminal law.
Of these alternatives neither the first or the second can be
contemplated as possible. Railroad transportation cannot be
abandoned, and no governmental ownership can, under present,
or any probably near future conditions, be brought about. We
have no sovereign government possessing the requisite powers.
It is the third alternative which must follow.
VII. These positions are fully supported by the weight of
authority.
'YIII. The agreement is in no manner in -violatibn of the
provisions of the second section of the act. It creates no
monopoly, nor is it an attempt, or conspiracy to monopolize.
-IX. In the attempt, made by the bill, to array every possi-
hle objection to the agreement, there is an evident purpose to

suggest that its eighth article, in connection with other sub-
sidiary provisions, constitutes pooling, and therefore is a viola-
tion of section 5 of the Interstate Commerce act. There is
no foundation for such a charge. The agreement in no manner
violates any provision of the Interstate Commerce law.
.Mr. E. J. Phe p8 for the New York Central and ]Eudson
River Railroad Company, appellee.
I. As the case is set down for hearing on bill and answers,
no fact alleged in the bill can be taken as true if denied in the
answers, and every fact alleged in the answers must be taken
to be true if responsive to the bill. The facts on which the
case stands are therefore to be found exclusively in the answers,
either in the admissions or in the responsive averments. which
they contain.
I. The denials in the answers completely negative all the
charges of illegal intent on the part of the defendants which
are contained in the bill, unless they are found to result
necessarily from the terms of the agreement itself.
IIL Whether the agreement by its terms violates the Federal
law, depends entirely on the inquiry whether it conflicts with
any statute of fhe United States. The- bill is not based upon
any statute, but proceeds apparently upon common law grounds.
No statute is referred to, or charged to have been violated.
IV. The only statutes of the United States that are claimed
to be infringed by the terms of the agreement, are the Inter-
state Commerce act, of February 4, 1887, amended by acts of
March 2, 1889, February 10, 1891, and- February 8, 1895,
and the Anti-Trust act of July 2, 1890.
V. The agreement violates no provision of the Interstate
Commerce act. The only provision in that act that is claimed
to be infringed, is contained in ยง 5, which prohibits "pooling."
"Pooling" meahs a division of the money earnings of traffic,
which this article does not contemplate.
VI. Even assuming that this clause in the agreement can
be construed into a violation of the 5th section of the Inter-
state Commerce act, this suit would not be maintainable, be-

cause it is unauthorized by that act, and precluded by its
express provisions.. This court has no power to grant an
injunction, either interlocutory or upon final decree, at the
suit of the United States Government, against the commission
of a crime, whdre no other grounds for the injunction exist
except that the act sought to be enjoined is an offence; unless
such power is specially conferred by statute. No such power
is granted.
VII. The Anti-Trust act of July 2, 1890, does not apply
to the business of railway transportation. It will be claimed
that the decision of this court in the case of the Trans-Mis-
souri Association, 166 U. S. 290, is decisive upon this point, as
well as upon the further question whether the agreement here
under consideration is a violation of the provisions of the Anti-
Trust act. It will be found on comparison that very material
differences exist between the agreement shown il that case,
and the case that is presented here. So that the decision
theve is by no means controlling in the present case. These
points of difference are clearly pointed out in the brief of Mr.
Edmunds, and need not be restated. But we conceive it not
to be improper, so far as it may be necessary, respectfully to
ask of the court a recbnsideration of the conclusions reached
by the majority of the judges in that decision, which over-
'rules the judgment of six United States Circuit and District.
Judges who sat in the different stages of that case and this.
The argument in opposition to it has been so fully, so-
clearly and so forcibly presented in the dissenting opinion of
Mr. Justice White, that it is hardly possible to add to it, nor
is it necessary to repeat it.
VIII. Assuming for the purposes of the argument, that the
Anti-Trust- law does apply to railway'traffic contracts, no pro-
vision of that law is violated by the agreement now under
consideration.
The prohibitions of the act are two: 1. Against contracts,
combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade or com-
merce. 2. The monopoly of, or the attempt or combination
to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of the States,
or with foreign nations.
