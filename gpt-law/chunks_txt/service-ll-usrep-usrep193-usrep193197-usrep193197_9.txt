It admits that the said lines so operated by said companies
connected with other railway lines, and that, either directly or
by means of such other railway lines, they connected with lines
of steamships on the Great Lakes and the ocean; and that the
mileage operated by said companies aggregated about fifty-five
hundred (5,500) miles for the Northern Pacific Company and
about forty-one hundred and twenty-eight (4,128) miles for the
Great Northern Company.
It denies that the lines operated by said companies are par-
allel or competing, except for the short distances and to the
limited extent hereinafter mentioned, and denies that said com-
