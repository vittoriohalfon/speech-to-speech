OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court. 196 U. S.
citing Brown v Walker, 161 U1 S. 591, Boyd v United States,
116 U S. 616.
Judges have differed as to the validity of aggregations of
capital effected by sonm form of organic union between several
smaller and competing corporations, and economists are far
from agreeing that such aggregations, within limitations, are
hurtful. So too, associations of manufacturers to regulate
competition within a restricted area have not always been
condemned by courts and have sometimes been approved by
publicists. But as yet no responsible voice has been heard to
justify, legally or economically, a conspiracy or agreement
between nearly all the producers of a commodity necessary to
life by which the confederates acquire absolute control and
dominion over the production, sale and distribution of that
commodity throughout the entire territory of a nation, with
the power, at will, to raise prices to the consumer of the finished
product and lower prices to the producer of the raw material.
Yet such is that now at the bar of this court. That there is a
conspiracy to control the market of the nation for fresh meats,
that it does control it, and that its control is merciless and
oppressive, are facts known of all men. The broad question
here is, Does the Government's petition, with its statements of
fact standing unchallenged, discover that conspiracy to the
court? We submit that it does and that the decree of the
Circuit Court should in all things be affirmed.
Mn. JuSTICE HOLmEs delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court, on
demurrer, granting an injunction against the appellants' com-
mission of alleged violations of the act of July 2, 1890, c. 647,
26 Stat. 209, "to protect trade and commerce against unlawful
restraints and monopolies." It will be necessary to consider
both the bill and the decree. The bill is brought against a
number of corporations, firms and individuals of different
States and makes the following allegations: 1. The defend-

ants (appellants) are engaged in the l)usiness of buying live
stock at the stock yards in Chicago, Omaha, St. Joseph,
Kansas City, East St. Louis and St. Paul, and slaughtering
such live stock at their respective plants in places named,
in different States, and converting the live stock into fresh
meat for human consumption. 2. The defendants "are also
engaged in the business of selling such fresh meats, at the
several places where they are so prepared, to dealers and con-
suniers in divers States and Territories of the said United
States other than those wherein the sai(d meats are so prepared
and sold as aforesaid, and in the District of Columbia, and in
foreign countries, and shipping the same meats, when so sold
from the said places of their preparation, over the several lines
of transportation of the several railroad companies serving the
same as common carriers, to such dealers and consumers,
pursuant to such sales." 3. The defendants also are engaged
in the business of slipping such fresh meats to their respective
agents at the principal markets in other States, etc., for sale
by those agents in those markets to dealers and consumers.
4. The defendants together control about six-tenths of the
whole trade and commerce in fresh meats among the States,
Territories and District of Columbia, and, 5, but for the acts
charged would be in free competition with one another.
6. In order to restrain competition among themselves as to
the purchase of live stock, defendants have engaged in, and
intend to continue, a combination for requiring and do and
will require their respective purchasing agents at the stock
yards mentioned, where defendants buy their live stock (the
same being stock produced and owned principally in other
States and shipped to the yards for sale), to refrain from
bidding against tach other, "except perfunctorily and without
good faith," and by this means compelling the owners of such
stock to sell at less prices than they would receive if the bidding
really was competitive.
7 For the same purposes the defendants combine to bid up,
through their agents, the prices of live stock for a few days at

a time, "so that the market reports will show prices much
higher than the state of the trade will warrant," thereby in- -
ducing stock owners in other States to make large shipments
to the stock yards to their disadvantage.
8. For the same purposes, and to monopolize the commerc
protected by the statute, the defendants combine "to ar-
bitrarily, from time to time raise, lower, and fix prices, and to
maintain uniform prices at which they will sell" to dealers
throughout the States. This is effected by secret periodical
meetings, where are fixed prices to be enforced until changed
at a subsequent meeting. The prices are maintained directly,
and by collusively restricting the meat shipped by the defend-
ants, whenever conducive to the result, by imposing penalties
for deviations, by establishing a uniform rule for the giving of
credit to dealers, etc., and by notifying one another of the
delinquencies of such dealers and keeping a black list of de-
linquents, and refusing to sell meats to them.
9. The defendants also combine to make uniform charges
for cartage for the delivery of meats sold to dealers and con-
sumers in the markets throughout the States, etc., shipped
to them by the defendants through the defendants' agents at
the markets, when no charges would have been made but for
the combination.
10. Intending to monopolize the said commerce and to pre-
vent competition therein, the defendants "have all and each
engaged in and will continue" arrangements with the railroads
whereby the defendants received, by means of rebates and
other devices, rates less than the lawful rates for transporta-
tion, and were exclusively to enjoy and share this unlawful
advantage to the exclusion of competition and the public.
By force of the consequent inability of competitors to engage
or continue in such commerce, the defendants are attempting
to monopolize, have monopolized, and will monopolize the
commerce in live stock and fresh meats among the States and
Territories, and with foreign countries, and, 11, the defend-
ants are and have been in conspiracy with each other, with
