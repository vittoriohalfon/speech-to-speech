tion of its supremacy, and of the supremacy as well of the
laws made in pursuance of its provisions, was a waste of words.
Whilst every instrumentality of domestic commerce is subject
to state control, every instrumentality of interstate commerce
may be reached and controlled by national authority, so far
as to compel it to respect the rules for such commerce lawfully
established by Congress. No corporate person can excuse a
departure from or violation of that rule under the plea that
that which it has done or omitted to do is permitted or not
forbidden by the State under whose authority it came into
existence. We repeat that no State can endow any of its
corporations, or any combination of its citizens, with authority
to restrain interstate or international commerce, or to disobey
the national will as manifested in legal enactments of Congress.
So long as Congress keeps within the limits of its authority as
defined by the Constitution, infringing no rights recognized or
secured by that instrument, its regulations of interstate and
international commerce, whether founded in wisdom or not,
must be submitted to by all. Harm and only harm can come
from the failure of the courts to recognize this fundamental
principle of constitutional construction. To depart from it
because of the circumstances of special cases, or because the
rule, in its operation, may possibly affect the interests of busi,
ness, is to endanger the safety and integrity of our institutions
and make the Constitution mean not what it says but what
interested parties wish it to mean at a particular time and
under particular circumstances. The supremacy of the law
is the foundation rock upon which our institutions rest. The
law, this court said in United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196, 220,
is the only supreme power in our system of government.
And no higher duty rests upon this court than to enforce, by
its decrees, the will of the legislative department of the Gov-
ernment, as expressed in a statute, unless such statute be
plainly and unmistakably in violation of the Constitution.
If the statute is beyond the constitutional power of Congress,
the court would fail in the performance of a solemn duty if it

did not so declare. But if nothing more can be said than that
Congress has erred-and the court must not be understood as
saying that it has or has not erred-the remedy for the error
and the attendant mischief is the selection -of new Senators
and Representatives, who, by legislation, will make such
changes in existing statutes, or adopt such new statutes, as
may be demanded by their constituents and be consistent with
law.
Many suggestions were made in argument based upon the
thought that the Anti-Trust Act would in the end prove to be
mischievous in its consequences. Disaster to business and
wide-spread financial ruin, it has been intimated, will follow
the execution of its provisions. Such predictions were made
in all the cases heretofore arising under that act. But they
have not been verified. It is the history of monopolies in this
country and in England that predictions of ruin are habitually
made by them when it is attempted, by legislation, to restrain
their operations and to protect the public against their exac-
tions. In this, as in former cases, they seek shelter behind
the reserved rights of the States and even behind the consti-
tutional guarantee of liberty of contract. But this court has
heretofore adjudged that the act of Congress did not touch the
rights of the States, and that liberty of contract did not involve
a right to deprive the public of the advantages of free com-
petition in trade and commerce. Liberty of contract does
not imply liberty in a corporation or individuals to defy the
national will, when legally expressed. Nor does the enforce-
ment of a legal enactment of Congress infringe, in any proper
sense, the general inherent right of every one to acquire and
hold property. That right, like all other rights, must be
exercised in subordination to the law.
But even if the court shared the gloomy forebodings in which
the defendants indulge, it could not refuse to respect the action
of the legislative branch of the Government if what it has done
is within the limits of its constitutional power. The sugges-
tions of disaster to business have, we apprehend, their origin

in the zeal of parties who are opposed to the policy underlying
the act of Congress or are interested in the result of this par-
ticular case; at any rate, the suggestions imply that the court
may and ought to refuse the enforcement of the provisions of
the act if, in its judgment, Congress was not wise in prescribing
as a rule by which the conduct of interstate and international
commerce is to be governed, that every combination, whatever
its form, in restraint of such commerce and the monopolizing
or attempting to monopolize such commerce shall be illegal.
These, plainly, are questions as to the policy of legislation
which belong to another department, and this court has no
function to supervise such legislation from the standpoint of
wisdom or policy. We need only say that Congress has au-
thority to declare, and by the language of its act, as interpreted
in prior cases, has, in effect declared, that the freedom of
interstate and international commerce shall not be obstructed
or disturbed by any combination, conspiracy or monopoly that
will restrain such commerce, by preventing the free operation
of competition among interstate carriers engaged in the trans-
portation of passengers and freight. This court cannot dis-
regard that declaration unless Congress, in passing the statute
in question, be held to have transgressed the limits prescribed
for its action by the Constitution. But, as already indicated,
it cannot be so held consistently with the provisions of that
instrument.
The combination here in question may have been for the
pecuniary benefit of those who formed or caused it to be
formed. But the interests of private persons and corporations
cannot be made paramount to the interests of the general
public. Under the Articles of Confederation commerce among
the original States was subject to vexatious and local regula-
tions that took no account of the general welfare. But it was
for the protection of the general interests, as involved in
interstate and international commerce, that Congress, repre-
senting the whole country, was given by the Constitution full
power to regulate commerce among the States and with foreign
