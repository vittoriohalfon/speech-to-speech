solidate, and the public thus gains the benefit of broader and
more economical administration. Railroads which compete
may not consolidate, because it prevents competition and keeps
up rates.
Public policy has demanded the prohibition of the consolida-
tion of competing lines; for the same reason Congress enacted
the antipooling section of the Interstate Commerce act. The
pooling of freights and the division of earnings is not bad in
itself. It is bad, because used to stifle competition. Equally
bad is the Joint Traffic agreement before the court, which
operates as effectively as any pooling arrangement ever devised.
The people have not stopped to inquire whether consolidation
would result of necessity in unreasonable rates; neither have
they stopped to inquire whether pooling would result neces-
sarily in unreasonable rates. It is the tendency, not the ab-
solute result, which has operated to prohibit consolidation, to
prohibit pooling, to prohibit contracts in restraint of trade.
The railroads say that if they are not permitted to prevent
competition they will compete and in doing so violate the
Interstate Commerce law; that they should be permitted to
combine for the purpose of preventing violations of law, even
if in doing so competition be prevented.
But to prevent competition is in itself to violate the law.
Better the chance to violate one law than the certainty of
violating another. Better the motive to violate one law than
the mandate to violate another. If the ability the railroads
employ to circumvent the law were used to observe it, neither
this agreement nor the arguments in support of it would be
before the court. The railroads-p romise to obey one law if the
court will permit them to violate another. Would they keep
the compact, if made? Respect for law based solely on self-
interest is delusive and evanescent.
XI. An attempt is made to distinguish this case from
the Trans-.Missouri case by saying that here the association
simply adopted the admitted fair and reasonable rates then in
force and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission by
the companies; while in the Trdns-31imsouri case the associa-
tion was given power to fix rates. But in the Trans-Missouri

agreement the association was only given power to fix reason-
able rates, and the fact that the rates fixed by the associatibn
during its existence were fair and reasonable was admitted.
In the Tan,-.Jissouri case, the association had been dis-
solved. The only question was the legal effect of the author-
ity conferred by the agreement. If there were no power
under the Joint Traffic agreement to change rates, neverthe-
less the power to maintain rates arbitrarily would involve
authority to keep them up after progress and invention should
render them excessive and unreasonable. But in point of fact,
as pointed out, the Joint Traffic agreement vests in the asso-
ciation, through the managers, with appeal to the board of
control, the authority to change rates. This authority is more
coercive than that conferred by the Trans-Missouri agreement.
Under the Trans-Missouri agreement five days' written
notice prior to each monthly meeting was required to be
given the chairman of any proposed reduction in rates. At
each monthly meeting the association voted on all changes
proposed. All parties were bound by the decision of the
association "unless then and there the parties shall give the
association definite written notice that in ten days thereafter
they shall make such modification, notwithstanding the vote
of the association. . . . Should any member insist upon
a reduction of rates against the views of the majority, and if
in the judgment of said majority the rates so made affect seri-
ously the rates upon through traffic, then the association may,
by a majority vote upon such other traffic, put into effect cor-
responding rates to take effect upon the same day." More-
over, each member of the Trans-Missouri association might,
at its peril, make a rate without previous notice to meet the
competition of outside lines, giving the chairman notice of
its action, so the good faith of the transaction might be passed
upon by the association at its next meeting.
Thus, under the Trans-Missouri agreement each member
might, at its peril, make a rate to meet outside competition,
and each member might, upon giving ten days' notice, make
an independent rate, notwithstanding the action of the associ-
ation. But under the Joint Traffic agreement no company can

deviate from the rates as fixed by the managers, except by a
resolution of its board of directors, and thirty days after a
copy of such resolution is filed with the managers. This
absolutely prevents competition, and the intention to prevent
competition is plain from the provision that "the managers,
upon receipt of such notice, shall act promptly upon the same
for the protection of the parties hereto."
Mr. Carter, in his argument, explained the operation of this
clause. Thirty days' notice of the intention of any company,
by resolution of its board, to deviate from the rates fixed by
the association, through its managers, was required in order
that the association might have time to determine its course
of action. If it could meet the rate proposed by the deviating
member, it would do so. If it could not, it would take steps,
in Mr. Carter's language, "to exterminate" the recalcitrant
company. In no other way, according to Mr. Carter, could
ruinous competition be prevented and the interests of all
members of the association protected.
XII. It may be conceded that the public along each line
is interested in the line getting its fair share of the through
traffic and earnings; and this it will get under competition.
The local public is not entitled, however, to an arbitrary share
of the through traffic and earnings. It has a right to no more
than the advantages of the line attract. To give it more is
to take what belongs to another line and another section. A
prosperous section, with an intelligent, progressive population,
makes a good railroad, and a good railroad attracts through
traffic; and it is not just or right to take this traffic away and
give it to a poor road in order to do for it what the public
along its line ought to do.-
XIII. The provisions of the Interstate Commerce law pre-
venting discrimination and undue preferences have been dis-
cussed; they can.be enforced without suppressing competition.
The tenth article of the Joint Traffic agreement provides that
"the managers shall decide and enforce the course which
s1hall be pursued with connecting companies not parties to
this agreement which fail or decline to observe the rates,
fares and rules established under this agreement," and it is
