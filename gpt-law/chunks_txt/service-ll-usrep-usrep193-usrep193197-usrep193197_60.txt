ment, and if that officer did not invoke the aid of the courts
to restrain the rights of the railroads previously chartered by
the States to enjoy the benefits conferred upon them by state
legislation, or to prevent individuals from exercising their
right of ownership and contract, the law in these respects
would remain a dead letter. But to indulge in this assumption
would be but to say that the law would not be enforced by the
highest law officer of the government, a conclusion which, of
course, could not be indulged in for a moment. In any view,
such suggestion but involves the proposition that vast rights
of property, instead of resting upon constitutional and legal
sanction, must alone depend upon whether an executive officer
might elect to enforce the law-a conclusion repugnant to
every principle of liberty and justice.
Having thus by the light of reason sought to show the un-
soundness of the proposition that the power of Congress to
regulate commerce extends to controlling the acquisition anld
ownership of stock in state corporations, railroad or otherwise,
because they may be doing an interstate commerce business,
or to the consolidation of such companies under the sanction
of state legislation, or to the right of the citizen to enjoy his
freedom of contract and ownership, let me now endeavor to
show, by a review of the practices of the governments; both
state and national, from the beginning and the adjudications
of this court, how wanting in merit is the proposition con-
tended for. It may not be doubted that from the foundation
of the government, at all events to the time of the adoption
of the Anti-Trust Act of 1890, there was an entire absence of
any legislation by Congress even suggesting that it was deemed
by any one that power was possessed by Congress to control
the ownership of stock in railroad or other corporations, b)e-
cause such corporations engaged in interstate commerce. On
the contrary, when Congress came to exert its authority to
regulate interstate commerce as carried on by railroads, nmni-
fested by the adoption of the interstate commerce act, 24 Star.
379, it sedulously confined the provisions of that act to the

carrying on of interstate commerce itself, including the reason-
ableness of the rates to be charged for carrying on such com-
merce and other matters undeniably concerning the fact of
interstate commerce. The same conception was manifested
subsequently in legislation concerning safety appliances to be
used by railroads, since the provisions of the act were confined
to such appliances when actually employed in the business of
interstate commerce. 27 Stat. 531. It also may not be
doubted that from the beginning the various States of the
Union have treated the incorporation and organization of
railroad companies and the ownership of stock therein as
matters within their exclusive authority. Under this con-
ception of power in the States, universally prevailing and
always acted upon, the entire railroad system of the United
States has been built up. Charters, leases and consolidations
under the sanction of state laws lie at the basis of that enor-
mous sum of property and those vast interests represented
by the railroads of the United States. Extracts from the
reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission and from a
standard authority on the subject, which were received in
evidence, demonstrate that in effect nearly every great railroad
system in the United States is the result of the consolidation
and unification of various roads, often competitive, such con-
solidation or unification of management having been brought
about in every conceivable form, sometimes by lease under
state authority, sometimes by such leases made where there
was no prohibition against them, and by stock acquisitions
made by persons or corporations in order to acquire a con-
trolling interest in both roads. Without stopping to recite
details on the subject, I content myself with merely mentioning
a few of the instances where great systems of railroad have been
formed by the unification of the management of competitive
roads, by consolidation or otherwise, often by statutory au-
thority. These instances embrace the Boston and Maine
system, the New York, New Haven and Hartford, the New
York Central, the Reading, and the Pennsylvania systems.

One of the illustrations-as to the New York Central system
-is the case of the Hudson River Railroad on one side of the
Hudson River and the West Shore Railroad on the other, both
parallel roads and directly competitive, and both united in
one management b.y authority of a legislative act. It is indeed
remarkable, if the whole subject was within the paramount
power of Congress and not within the authority of the States,
that there should have been a universal understanding to the
contrary from the beginning. When it is borne in mind that
such universal action related to interests of the most vital
character, involving property of enormous amount concerning
the welfare of the whole people, it is impossible in reason to
deny the soundness of the assumption that it was the universal
conviction that the States, and not Congress, had control of
the subject matter of the organization and ownership of rail-
roads created by the States. -And the same inference is appli-
cable to the condition of things which has existed since the
adoption of the Anti-Trust Act in 1890. Who can deny that
from that date to this consolidations and unification of man-
agement, by means of leases, stock ownership by individuals
or corporations, have been carried on, when not prohibited by
state laws, to a vast extent, and that during all this time,
despite the energy of the government in invoking the Anti-
Trust Law, that no assertion of power in Congress under that
act to control the ownership of stock was ever knowingly made
until first asserted in this cause. Quite recently Congress has
amended the interstate commerce act by provisions deemed
essential to make its prohibitions more practically operative,
and yet no one of such provisions lends itself even to the
inference that it was deemed by any one that the power of
Congress extended to the control of stock ownership. Cer-
tainly the States have not so considered it. As a matter of
public history it is to be observed that not long since, by
authority of the legislature of the State of Massachusetts, a
controlling interest by lease of the Boston and Albany road
passed to the New York Central system.
