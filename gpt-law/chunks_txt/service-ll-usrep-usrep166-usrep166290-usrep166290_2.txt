OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Statement of the Case.
"2. All freight traffic originating within the territory as
defined in the first section when destined to points east of
the aforesaid Missouri River line."
Certain exceptions to the above article are then stated as
to the particular business of several railway companie, which
was to be regarded as outside and beyond the provisions of
the agreement.
Article II provided for the election of a chairman of the
organization and for meetings at Kansas City, or otherwise,
as might be provided for. By section 2 of that article each
road was to "designate to the chairman one person who shall
be held personally responsible for rates on that road. Such
person shall be present at all regular meetings, when possible,
and shall represent his road, unless a superior officer is present.
If unable to attend he shall send a substitute with written au-
thority to act upon all questions which may arise, and the
vote of such substitute shall be binding upon the company
he represents."
Section 3 provides that: "A committee shall be appointed
to establish rates, rules and regulations on the traffic subject
to this association, and to consider changes therein, and make
rules for meeting the competition of outside lines. Their con-
clusions, when unanimous, shall be made effective when they
so order, but if they differ the question at issue shall be re-
ferred to the managers of the lines parties hereto; and if they
disagree it shall be arbitrated in the manner provided in
article VII."
By section 4 it was provided that: "At least five days'
written notice prior to each monthly meeting shall be given
the chairman of any proposed reduction in rates or change in
any rule or regulation governing freight traffic; eight days in
so far as applicable to the traffic of Colorado or Utah."
Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of article II read as follows:
"Sc. 5. At each monthly meeting the association shall
consider and vote upon all changes proposed, of which due
notice has been given, and all parties shall be bound by the
decision of the association, as expressed, unless then and there

the parties shall give ttie association definite written notice
that, in ten days thereafter, they shall make such modification
notwithstanding the vote of the association: Provided, That
if the member giving notice of change shall fail to be repre-
sented at the meeting, no action shall be taken on its notice,
and the same shall be considered withdrawn. Should any
member insist upon a reduction of rate against the views of
the majority, or if the majority favor the same, and if, in the
judgment of such majority, the rate so made affects seriously
the rates upon other traffic, then the association may, by a
majority vote, upon such other traffic put into effect corre-
sponding rates to take effect on the same day. By unanimous
consent, any rate, rule or regulation relating to freight traffic
may be modified at any meeting of the association without
previous notice.
"SEC. 6. Notwithstanding anything in this article contained,
each member may,. at its peril, make at any time, without
previous notice, such rate, rule or regulations as may be neces-
sary to meet the competition of lines not members of the
association, giving at the same time notice to the chairman of
its action in the premises. If the chairman, upon investigation,
shall decide that such rate is not necessary to meet the direct
competition of lines not members of the association, and shall
so notify the road making the rate, it shall immediately with-
draw such rate. At the next meeting of the association held
after the making of such rate, it shall be reported to the
association, and if the association shall decide by a two-thirds
vote that such rate was not made in good faith to meet such
competition, the member offending shall be subject to the
penalty provided in section 8 of this article. If the associa-
tion shall decide by a two-thirds vote that such rate was made
in good faith to meet such competition, it shall be considered
as authority for the rate so made.
"SEC. 7. All arrangements with connecting lines for the
division of through rates relating to traffic covered by this
agreement shall be made by authority of the association:
Provided, however, That when one road has a proprietary
interest in another, .the divisions between such roads shall be
