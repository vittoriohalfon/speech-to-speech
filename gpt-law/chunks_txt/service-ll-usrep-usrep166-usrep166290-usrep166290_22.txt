v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, where general language found in
the body of a criminal statute was given a narrow and re-
stricted meaning, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in the course
of the opinion, said (p. 631); "The title of an act cannot
control its words, but may furnish some aid in showing what
was in the mind of the legislature. The title of this act is
' An act for the punishment of certain crimes against the
United States.' It would seem that offences against the
United States, not Offences against the human race, were
the crimes which the legislature intended by this law to
punish."
So, also, in United States v. Union Pacific Railroad, 91
U. S. 72, where the construction of a statute was involved,
it was held that the interpretation adopted was supported
by the title, which disclosed the general purpose which Con-
gress had in view in adopting the law under consideration.
The same rule was announced in Smythe v. Fiske, 23 Wall.
374, 380, and Coosaw Mining Co. v. South Carolina, 144 U. S.
550, and cases there cited.
Pretermitting the consideration of the title, it cannot be
denied that the words "restraint of trade" used in the act
in question had long prior to the adoption of that act been
construed as not embracing reasonable contracts. The well-
settled rule is that where technical words are used in an act,
and their meaning has previously been conclusively settled,
by long usage and judicial construction, the use of the words
without an indication of an intention to give them a new
significance is an adoption of the generally accepted meaning
affixed to the words at the time the act was passed. Particu-
larly is this rule imperative where the statute in which the
words are used creates a crime, as does the statute under
consideration, and gives no specific definition of the crime
created. Thus in United States v. Palmer (supra), Mr. Chief
Justice Marshall, referring to the term "robbery" as used in
the statute, said (p. 630): "Of the meaning of the term
'robbery,' as used in the statute, we think no doubt can be
entertained. It must be understood in the sense in which
it is recognized and defined at common law."

If these obvious rules of interpretation be applied, it seems
to me they render it impossible to construe the words every
restraint of trade used in the act in any other sense than as
excluding reasonable contracts, as the fact that such contracts
were not considered to be within the rule of contracts in re-
straint of trade, was thoroughly established both in England
and in this country at the time the act was adopted. It is,
I submit, not to be doubted that the interpretation of the
words "every contract in restraint of trade," so as to embrace
within its purview every contract, however reasonable, would
certainly work an enormous injustice and operate to the undue
restraint of the liberties of the citizen. But there is no canon
of interpretation which requires that the letter be followed,
when by so doing an unreasonable result is accomplished.
On the contrary, the rule is the other way, and exacts that
the spirit which vivifies, and not the letter which killeth, is
the proper guide by which to correctly interpret a statute.
In Smythe v. Fiske, 23 Wall. 374, 380, this court declared
that "a thing may be within the letter of the statute and
not within its meaning, and within its meaning, though not
within its letter. The intention of the lawmaker is the law."
In -au Ow Bew v. The United States, 144 U. S. 47, this court,
speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, said (p. 59):
"Nothing is better settled than that statutes should receive
a sensible construction, such as will effectuate the legislative
intention, and, if possible, so as to avoid an unjust or an
absurd conclusion. Church of the 11oly Trinity v. United
States, 143 U. S. 457; Henderson v. Mayor of New York, 92
U. S. 259; United States v. Kirby, 7 Wall. 482; Oates v.
National Bank, 100 U. S. 239."
In all the cases there cited the literal language of the statutes
was disregarded, in order to restrict its operation within reason.
To those cases may also be added United States v. Mooney,
116 U. S. 104, where it was contended that by the act of
March 3, 1875, c. 137, the Circuit Courts were vested with
jurisdiction concurrent with District Courts over certain suits.
The plausibility of the argument, based upon the literal lan-
guage of the statute, was conceded by the court, but the

results which would follow from sustaining the construction
contended for were pointed out by the court, and it was ob-
served (p. 107): "A construction which involves such results
was clearly not contemplated by Congress."
Indeed, it seems to me there can be no doubt that reason-
able contracts cannot be embraced within the provisions of
the statute if it be interpreted by the light of the supreme
rule commanding that the intention of the law must be car-
ried out, and it must be so construed as to afford the remedy
and frustrate the wrong contemplated by its enactment.
The plain intention of the law was to protect the liberty of
contract and the freedom of trade. Will this intention not
be frustrated by a construction which, if it does not destroy,
at least gravely impairs, both the liberty of the individual to
contract and the freedom of trade? If the rule of reason no
longer determines the right of the individual to contract or
secures the validity of contracts upon which trade depends
and results, what becomes of the liberty of the citizen or of
the freedom of trade? Secured no longer by the law of
reason, all these rights become subject, when questioned, to
the mere caprice of judicial authority. Thus, a law in favor
of freedom of contract, it seems to me, is so interpreted as to
gravely impair that freedom. Progress and not reaction was
the purpose of the act of Congress. The construction now
given the act disregards the whole current of- judicial au-
thority and tests the right to contract by the conceptions of
that right entertained at the time of the year-books instead
of by the light of reason and the necessity of modern society.
To do this violates, as I see it, the plainest conception of
public policy; for as said by Sir G. Jessel, Master of the
Rolls, in Printing &o. Company v. Sampson, L. R. 19 Eq. 462,
"if there is one thing which more than another public policy
requires it is that men of full age and competent understand-
ing shall have the utmost liberty of contracting, and their
contracts when entered into freely and voluntarily shall be
held sacred and shall be enforced by courts of justice."
The remedy intended to be accomplished by the act of Con-
gress was to shield against the danger of contract or combi-
