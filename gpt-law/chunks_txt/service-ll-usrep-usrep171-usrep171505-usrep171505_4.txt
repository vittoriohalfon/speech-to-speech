OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Mr. Carter's Argument for The Joint Traffic Association.
The first question we design to consider is whether the
agreement viol.ates any of the provisions of the act referred to.
To this end it is of much importance to have in mind the par-
ticular nature of the subject with which this act deals, and how
that subjedt has heretofore been treated in law and legislation.
It is immediately obvious that Congress conceived itself. to
be dealing with acts supposed to be pioductive .of injury to
the public, and of injury to such an extent as to justify
repressive legislation.
We next observe that it is not contracts only of a certain
character which are condemned, but that they are coupled
together with certain* other ;ts, presumably of a similar
nature or iendenqy, nanely, combinations or conspiracies in
restraint, of trade, and monopolies, or combinations or con-
spiracies to monopolize. Contracts, therefore, are dealt with,
not so much as contracts, but as one form of acts relating to
trade and commerce assumed to bo injurious in their tendency
and effect.
That contracts of a certain class may be opposed to a"sound
public policy has been recognized in- the law from a very early
period. The grounds or reasons of policy upon which, they
are held void or illegal are very numerous and varied, but a
class embracing numerous instances is formed of such as are
supposed to have an injurious effect .upon trade or commerce;
between these, however, there is quite a marked distinction
observable in the way in which they are treated in the law.
One description embraces simply ordinary business transac-
tions, where parties make agreements with each other for
supposed mutual profit and advantage, a breach of which
would result in pecuniary loss or damage to the one or the
other, and a demand for redress. In such cases the parties
expect and intend to enforce the contract, and look to the
ordinary legal remedies as the means of enforcing it. Con-
tracts whereby a business-is sold and the seller covenants that
he will not thereafter carry it on, or where a man takes an
apprentice with an agreement that he will not set himself up
in opposition to his master in trade, supply familiar instances
of this character.

UNITED STATES v. JOINT TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION. 515
Mr. Carter's Argument for The Joint Traffic Association.
Inasmuch as such contracts would not be entered into unless
it Was believed that the law would afford redress in case of a
breabh of them, the repressive purposes of the law, where they
are supposed to be opposed to public policy, are, in general,
fully satisfied by declaring them void and denying redress, and
this is usually the extent of the notice which the law takes of
them. There is no occasion for criminal legislation, both for
the reason that there is not present, ordinarily, any criminal pur-
pose, and if there were, repression is sufficienily accomplished
without a resortgto it. The doctrine respecting contracts.of this
character belongs therefore to the law of contracts, and the
treatises on that law usually embrace a chapter devoted to it.
But there is another and much smaller description of con-
tracts supposed to be injurious to trade of quite a different
character. They are not, properly speaking, business trans-
actions. They do not involve the sale, leasing or exchange-
of property, or the hire of services; nor does a breach of
them usually result in distinct and ascertainable pecuniary
loss. They are not, indeed, entered into by parties in differ-
ent interests, as in the case of buyer and seller, one of which
expects to gain something from the other, but by parties in
the same interest having in view an object for the common
good of all; nor do the parties to them generally look to, or
rely upon, any legal remedies to secure obedience to them.
They spring out of circumstances which impress the parties
to them with the belief that they have a common interest, or
that it is expedient to create a common interest among them,
and seek to control or regulate the conduct of each other in
relation to business. Instances of this description of agree-
ment are found where laborers, or employers, unite, in the
form of agreement, to regulate hours of labor, or prices, or
where merchants, or tradesmen, combine to transact their
business in certain prescribed ways, or to establish uniform
prices for their goods, or to suppress, or regulate, competition
among themselves; or where a class of producers or dealers
combine together to control a product, or a business, with a
view of imposing -dpon others their own terms as to prices, or
other incidents of the business.,

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Mr. Carter's 'Argument for The Joint Traffic Association.
The marked distinction -between these cases and the ordi-
nary business transactions first spoken of is, that in the latter
there is a difference of interest, sometimes regarded as a hos-
tility of interest between the parties, each seeking to gain the
utmost from the other; whereas, in the former, the parties
are in the same inferest, each seeking the same end. The
term "contract" does not well express this sort of agreement.
It is a uniting together for a common purpose -a combina-
tion- or, wheii thought to be of an objectionable character, a
conspiracy. Such unions always suppose agreement, but it
need not be in writing; where it is in writing it is often called
an agreement, or contract; but, in giving it this name we
should not lose sight of its real character. In reality it is
simpiy an act, and innocent, or guilty, according as the law
may be inclined to regard it.
It is manifest that where the law does regard it as mischiev-
ous, and to such a degree as to call for repression, it is not
enough to simply declare it illegal. The practice may, never-
theless, be persisted in, and as it does 'not rely for its efficacy
upon legal remedies, the mere withholding of such remedies
may be ineffectual. The action, therefore,- which law usually
takes in respect to such so called contracts is in the form of
prohibition and penalty, and the subject belongs not to the
law of contracts, but to -the criminal law, where it is usually
dealt with under the head of conspiracy.
We do not mean by the above observations that there may
not be instances which partake, to a greater or less degree, of
the qualities of both the classes above mentioned; but 'the dis-
tinction between them is so constant and pervading that it
will be at once recognized.
As a conclusion to what is said we desire to point out that
the legal doctrine and policy to which this Anti-Trust act be-
longs, is manifestlythe one last described. The circumstance
that contracts are grouped together with combinations and
conspiracies and made the subject of criminal treatment, sbows
this very plainly.
The ineptitude of some of the language of this legislation is
quite apparent. Undoubtedly the object of Congress was to
