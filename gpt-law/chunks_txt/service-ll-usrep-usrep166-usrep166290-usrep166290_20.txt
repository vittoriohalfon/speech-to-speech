the subject were forbidden. The doctrine declared in that
case was applied in subsequent cases in England prior to the
case of Mitchel v. Reynolds, decided in 1711, and reported in
1 P. Wins. 181. There the distinction between general re-
straints and partial restraints was first definitely formulated,
and it was held that a contract creating a partial restraint
was valid and one creating a general restraint was not. The
theory of partial and general restraints established by that
case was followed in many decided cases in England, not,
however, without the correctness of the difference between
the two being in some instances denied and in others ques-
tioned, until the matter was set finally at rest by the House
of Lords in Nordenfelt v. The Maxim -Nordenfelt Guns and
Ammunition Co., reported in (1894) App. Cas. 535. In that
case it was held that the distinction between partial and gen-
eral restraint was an incorrect criterion, but that whether a
contract was invalid because in restraint of trade must de-
pend upon whether, on considering all the circumstances, the
contract was found to be reasonable or unreasonable. If rea-
sonable, it was not a contract in restraint of trade, and if
unreasonable it was.
The decisions of the American courts substantially conform
to both the development and ultimate results of the English
cases. Whilst the rule of partial and general restraint has
been either expressly or impliedly admitted, the exact scope of
the distinction between the two has been the subject of dis-
cussion and varying adjudication. And although it is accurate
to say that in the cases expressions may be found speaking of
contracts as being in form, in restraint of trade and yet valid,
it results from an analysis of all the American cases, as it does
from the English, that these expressions in no way imply that
contracts which were valid because they only partially re-
strained trade were yet considered as embraced within the
definition of contracts in restraint of trade. On the contrary,
the reason of the cases, where contracts partially restraining
trade were excepted and hence held to be valid, was because
they were not contracts in restraint of trade in the legal
meaning of those words. Referring to the modern and Ameri-

can rule on the subject, Beach in his recent treatise on the
Modern Law of Contracts, at section 1569, says:
"The tendency of modern thought and decisions has been no
longer to uphold in its strictness the doctrine which formerly
prevailed respecting agreements in restraint of trade. The
severity with which such agreements were treated in the
beginning has relaxed more and more by exceptions and
qualilfications, and a gradual change has taken place, brought
about by the growth of industrial activities, and the enlarge-
ment of, commercial facilities which tend to render such
agreements less dangerous, because monopolies are less easy
of accomplishment."
The fact that the exclusion of reasonable contracts from
the' doctrine of restraint of trade was predicated on the
conclusion that such contracts were no longer considered as
coming within the meaning of the words "restraint of trade,"
is nowhere more clearly and cogently stated than in the
opinion of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York,
in the case of 3fatthews v. Associated Press of 2tfew York,
136 N. Y. 333. In considering the contention that a by-law
of the defendant association which prohibited its members
from receiving or publishing "the regular news dispatches of
any other news association covering a like territory and or-
ganized for a like purpose" was void, because it tended to
restrain trade and competition and to create a monopoly, the
learned judge said (p. 340):
"We do not think the by-law improperly tends to restrain
trade, assuming that the business of collecting and distributing
news would come within the definition of a trade. The latest
decisions of courts in this country and in England show a
strong tendency to very greatly circumscribe and narrow the
doctrine of avoiding contracts in restraint of trade. The
courts do not go to the length of saying that contracts which
they now would say are in restraint of trade are, nevertheless,
valid contracts, and to be enforced; they do, however, now
hold many contracts not open to the objection that they are in
restraint of trade which a few years back would have been
avoided on that sole grouind, both here and in England. The

cases in this court which are the latest manifestations of the
turn in the tide are cited in the opinion in this case at general
term, and are -Diamond Match Co. v. Roeber, 106 N. Y. 73;
Hodge v. Neill, 107 N. Y. 244; Leslie v. Lorillard, 110
N. Y. 519.
"So that when we agree that a by-law which is in restraint
of trade is void, we are still brought back to the question what
is a restraint of trade in the modern definition of that term ?
The authority to make by-laws must also be limited by the
scope and purpose of the association. I think this by-law
is thus limited, and that it is not in restraint of trade as the
courts now interpret thatp hrase."
This lucid statement aptly sums up the process of reasoning
by which partial and reasonable contracts came no longer to
be considered as included in the words contracts in restraint of
trade, and points to the fallacy embodied in the proposition
that contracts which were held not to be in restraint of trade
were yet covered by the words in restraint of trade; that is,
that although they were not such contracts, yet they con-
tinued so to be. After analyzing the provisions of the by-law
the opinion proceeds as follows (p. 341):
"Thus a by-law of the nature complained of would have
a tendency to strengthen the association and to render it more
capable of filling the duty it was incorporated to perform. A
business partnership could provide that none of its members
should attend to any business other than that of the partner-
ship, and that each partner who came in must agree not to do
any other business and must give up all such business as he had
theretofore done. Such an agreement would not be in restraint
of trade, although its direct effect might be to restrain to
some extent the trade which had been done."
This adds cogency to the demonstration, and shows in the
most conclusive manner that the words contracts in restraint
of trade do not continue to define those contracts which are
no longer covered by the legal meaning of the words.
This court has not only recognized and applied the distinction
between partial and general restraints, but has also decided
that the true test whether a contract be in restraint of trade is
