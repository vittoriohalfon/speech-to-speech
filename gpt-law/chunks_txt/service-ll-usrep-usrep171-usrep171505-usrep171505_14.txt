this does not restrain the operations of the locomotive; it is
necessary-to its best and safest performance of duty. A hun-
dred illustrations might be given.
My brother on the other side suggests that the clause in the
agreement providing for abolishing soliciting agencies is a
restraint of the trade. I havestated in my printed points my
answer to this. I may add, however, that soliciting trade or
ceasing to solicit trade is not trade itself, and does not belong
to it, even as an incident. Wherever it is practised, it is prac-
tised apart from any act of trade; it precedes it, and some-
times leads up to it, and sometimes repels it. It was pegfectly
competent,. therefore, and certa inly wise, for these roads to
agree to abolish such agencies, and to join, so far as it might
be convenient to do for the infoimation of the public, in hav-
ing agencies at various important points to assist shippers and
manufacturers in the most rapid and economical transmission
of their productions. The plan, therefore, substituted for the
old practice is one far more advantageous to the public who
wish for honest and equal dealing. than the old practice. But
I submit that whatever character, may be imputed to solicit-
ing business, it does not fall within the authority of Congress
to regulate it at all. While it is going on the business solicited
has not reached the point of being interstate commerce, and
cannot reach it until its movement has commenced, or is about
to commence, definitely from one State to another.
I refrain from making any observations on the constitutional
question arising if the Trust act is to be construed as forbid-
ding innocent contracts promotive of public policy, which I
have insisted upon in my printed points, for the reason that in
the division of our subjects of discussion this matter is left
entirely to my brother Mr. Phelps.
In respect of the meaning of the words of the Trust act,
I beg to ask your Honors' careful attention to the suggestions
I have ventured to make in my printed points. I need not
enlarge upon themA and have only to call your attention, first,
to the grammatical construction of the first section, and,
second, to the citations I have made from law writers, show-
ing a distinct and separate classificatibn of the two phrases,

"restraint of trade in general" and "partial restraint of trade."
If these writers are correct (as nobody doubts, I think, they
are), and the two phrases were known and treated in the law
at the time of the passage of the act as separate things, the one
obnoxious and the other just and wholesome; then I respect-
fully and earnestly insist that the universal rule of construc-
tion requires that the words in the act shall be assigned to
the first class, and not carried over into the second.
Mr. Solicitor General, for the United States, in conclusion.
I. It is claimed that because nothing has been done under
the agreement, no irreparable injury has been or can be shown,
and therefore no injunction lies. But the Anti-Trust law
makes the agreement illegal and vests the court with jurisdic-
tion to prevent violations of the act. The carrying out of an
illegal contract will result in irreparable injury to the public,
and this sufficiently appears from the provision of the law de-
claring the illegality and authorizing injunction proceedings.
II. It is insisted that an agreement in restraint of trade
must restrain trade - that is, reduce or diminish it; that trade
must be injured.
An agreement in restraint of trade may or may not diminish
or reduce trade. The injury sought to be averted by prohibit-
ing such agreements is the injury to the public. The stifling
of competition, the creation of a monopoly, may increase the
trade in the product controlled, but nevertheless to the injury
of the public. To stifle competition is to create a monopoly
and place the public at the mercy of the monopoly. The
benefits resulting from cheaper products through monopolies
have never been held by courts or legislatures as sufficient to
overbalance the evils to the Government and people from
the creation of monopolies. It is a question of method rather
than result. Trusts and monopolies are forbidden in order to
preserve competition, and thereby, as far as possible, freedom
of action in industrial and commercial life.
III. It is said that competition is not trade, but a mere
incident of, trade; that what prevents competition does not

necessarily injure trade; on the contrary, to restrict competi-
tion may benefit trade, that the whole world is now groaning
under competition; that the hard rule of the survival of the
fittest bears heavily upon the mass of the people; that there
is a spirit of unrest, of dissatisfaction, and that to avoid the
effects of ruinous competition among employers and employ~s
combination is the rule.
It may be conceded that the law of the survival of the fit-
test is a hard one; that the necessity of competition under
existing conditions presses heavily upon the weak. But, after
all, competition is not only the life of trade, but the underlying
basis of our social and industrial life. There may be a better
way, but we have not yet found it. Competition goes along
with freedom, with independent action. This country was
founded on the principles of liberty and equality. It sought
to secure to every citizen an equal chance under the law.
That is all the people have demanded or do demand -a fair
show in the race of life. Undoubtedly there is unrest, dis-
satisfaction, tendencies to anarchy and socialism, but these
result not from competition, but the throttling of competition
by trusts and combinations, which seek to control production
and transportation and dominate both workingmen and con-
sumers. Against these the individual citizen protests. He
does not demand no competition, but fair competition. Com-
binations of workingmen accompany aggregations of capital.
Thus the masses are arrayed against the classes. If combina-
tions of capital were prevented, if competition among employ-
ers of labor were enforced, the independent demand for labor
from competing sources would tend to fair wages, such as
prices might warrant.
IV. It is insisted that this agreement among railroads to
prevent competition is not only innocent, but wise and salu-
tary, because in the case of railroads competition is ruinous;
that if competition reduces rates below the point of profit for
any line, it must ultimately be bankrupted, for it cannot stop
running nor can the capital invested in it be withdrawn.
But this argument applies to all great modern industries,
in manufacture as well as transportation. Capital fixed in a
