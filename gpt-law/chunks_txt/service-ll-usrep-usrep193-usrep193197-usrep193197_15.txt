respectively, the rates are fixed by joint tariffs with connecting
lines. In respect to all such traffic neither of the defendant
companies has ever had, or can have, any independent rate-
making power or control of traffic or rates. All jointtariffs with
other companies to or from points common to the lines of the
defendant railway companies have always been, and necessarily
must be, the same, whether the traffic is carried by one or the
other of said companies. The total amount of all other inter-
state traffic, that is, traffic between common points on the two
roads, which is not competitive both as to rates and quality of
service with other carriers having equal rate-making power
with them, is less than 2 per cent of the total interstate traffic
of the two companies.
IV. The sale and transfer of property, whether in the form of
shares of corporate stock or otherwise, has never been adjudged
to be, and is not, in violation of the act of Congress of July 2,
1890, known as the "Anti-Trust Act."
This defendant is not a railroad company, and it has no
power to. operate or manage railways or make or control rates
of transportation, nor to monopolize or restrain traffic of any
kind. So far from intending to violate any provision of said
act of Congress, the persons who were concerned in organizing
this defendant and those who have sold their shares to it had
every reason to believe and did believe that such sales were
not in any way in contravention of that act. In common with
the general public, they were aware that during the eleven
years since the passage of that act in many instances the stock
of a competing railway company has been acquired by its com-
petitor or the shareholders thereof, such acquisition including
many of the principal railivays doing business throughout the
country. This has been done without objection from any
branch of the Government of the United States, and has
invariably proven beneficial to the railway companies con-
cerned and to the public, and those making sales of stocks
to this defendant had no reason to believe that such sales
were open to any legal objection or question whatever.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Answer of Northern Securities Company. 193 U. S.
V. This defendant was not organized for the purpose of ac-
quiring a majority of the stock of either the Great Northern or
the Northern Pacific Company, but merely to purchase ie
stock of those who wished to sell, as above stated, and was not.
organized for the purpose of controlling railway rates in the
slightest degree, and has not had and cannot have any such
effect. The transactions referred to in the petition have con-
sisted in the organization of a lawful corporation and the pur-
chase of property by it. All acts (lone in relation to the organi-
zation of this defendant and in the conduct of its business have
been expressly authorized by law, and have had no effect,
whatever to restrain trade or commerce among the several
States or with foreign nations. If these lawful transactionjs
should hereafter have any effect to restrain trade or commerce
among the several States or with foreign nations (which is
hereby denied), that effect would be merely indirect, remote,
incidental, and collateral, and not intended, and as nothing
compared with the great expansion of the volume of interstate
and international commerce which was intended, and which
this defendant believes is destined to result from the enier-
prise of the two railway companies, that culminated in the
purchase of the Burlington stock.
And this defendant says:
1. The "Anti-Trust Act" was not intended to prevent, or
defeat an enterprise in aid of a great competitive interstate
and international commerce merely because such enterprise
may carry with it the possibility of incidental restraint
upon some commerce, trifling both as respects territory anid
volume.
2. Nor was the act intended to limit the power of the several
States to create corporations, define their purposes, fix the
amount of their capital, and determine who may buy, own, and
sell their stock.
3. Otherwise construed, the act would be unconstitutional,
because:
The power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and

among the States does not give Congress the power to regulate
any of the matters above mentioned in respect to corporations
created by the States; and because
Persons may not be deprived of their property without due
process of law, by taking from them the right to sell it as their
interest may suggest.
VI. There is a defect of necessary parties defendant, because,
as already set forth, the persons who made sales of stock of the
said. railway companies to this defendant were numerous, ex-
ceeding more than 1,300 in number, and few of them had any
connection whatever in the planning or forming of this de-
fendant, and in their absence from this litigation no decree can
be made affecting their rights in the premises.
VII. And this defendant denies all and all manner of unlawful
combination and confederacy wherewith it is by the said peti-
tion charged, without this, that if there is any other matter,
cause, or thing in the petition contained material or necessary
for this defendant to make answer unto, and not herein or
hereby well and sufficiently answered, confessed, traversed,
and avoided or denied, the same is not true to the knowledge
or belief of this defendant; all of which matters and things this
defendant is ready and willing to aver, maintain, and prove as
this honorable court shall direct, and humbly prays to be hence
dismissed, with its reasonable costs and charges in this behalf
most wrongfully sustained.
