Mr. Solicitor General's Argument for United States.
contended .that this provision is necessary to prevent dis-
crimination against one company and in favor of another by
connecting lines; but a reading of the*t hird section of the
.Interstate Commerce act shows that the mischief suggested is
fully provided for in its concluding paragraph, which provides
that every common carrier shall afford equal facilities for the
interchange of traffic and for receiving and forwarding freight
or passengers from connecting lines, "and shall not discrimi-
nate in their.rates and charges between such connecting lines."
XIV. It is insisted that if Congress had intended the Anti-
Trust law to prohibit every contract in restraint of trade,
whether partial, or general, reasonable or unreasonable, it
would have used the language "every contract in any re-
straint of trade," etc., "is hereby declared to be illegal."
It seems to me, and I submit to the court, that the expres-
sion "every contract in restraint of trade" is quite as compre-
hensive as "every contract in any restraint of trade," and
Imuch better language. With due respect to the learned coun-
sel, it might be suggested that if his criticism of the language
used be a valid one, why may not the next commentator
on this section forcefully insist that Congress should have said
"every contract in any and every restraint of trade is hereby
declared to be illegal" ?
XV. -The reply to Mr. Phelps' attack upon the constitu-
tionality of the Anti-Trust law as construed by this court in
the Tr=ans-Missouric ase, is to be found in the argument of Mr.
-Carter that railways are public highways, and in the furnish-
ing of public transportation perform in a sense a govern-
mental function. The right of the Government to regulate
contracts between carriers and shippers and to place proper
restrictions upon contracts among carriers themselves, in order
to protect the interests of the public, as affected by these in-
strumentalities of commerce, has not heretofore been seriously
questioned. The States regulate the construction, mainte-
nance, and operation of railroads, prescribing and enforcing
maximum rates, preventing the consolidation of competing
lines, and securing to the public the benefit of competition.
The doctrine laid down in the case of Munn v. Illinois, 94:

UNITED STATES v.J OINT TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION. 557
Mr. Solicitor General's Argument for United States.
U. 5. 113, applies. When a man devotes his property to a pub-
lic use, to that extent he grants the public an interest in that
use. The same policy which supports the prohibition against
consolidation, and the fifth section of the Interstate Com-
merce law forbidding the pooling of freights or the division
of earnings, is the justification for, the declaration that all
contracts in restraint of -trade shall be deemed illegdil. The
result of the consolidation, the pooling or the combination in
restraint of trade, is beside the question. Congress is entitled
to pass judgment upon the tendency of a contract in restraint
of trade. If it deems such a contract reprehensible, injuri-
ous in its tendencies, it may prohibit it, whether the act will.
result in a particular case in the establishmefit of reasonable
or unreasonable rates.
XVI. As to the remedy in the case of an unreasonably
low rate. Judge Cooley, in a well-considered opinion, In re
Chicago, St. Paul & Kansas City Railway, 2 Int. Com. Com.
231, approved by this court in Interstate Commerce Commission
v. Cincinnati,N . 0. & Texas Pacific Railway, 167 U. S. 479,
511, held that under the Interstate Commerce law the com-
mission has no power to determine that a rate is unreasonably
low and to order the carrier to refrain from charging such
rate on such ground.
XVI1. As to the remedy in the case of an unreasonably
high rate.
The common law requires that rates shall be reasonable
and fair. So does the Interstate Commerce law. But this is
a mere declaration, and there is no adequate remedy to en-
force the right. The commission has no power to prescribe
a reasonable rate and enforce it, or to declare that a rate
is unreasonable and prohibit it. The shipper is therefore
left to recover the excess in rate paid. I know of no case
where the excess. charged over a reasonable rate on interstate
commerce has been recovered back. The amount involved in
any particular transaction would be small; it would require
years to carry the case through the courts, and no individual
shipper would invite the ill will of a powerful railroad by
beginning such a contest.

. Opinion of the Court.
Moreover, the man who actually pays the freight is not the
man who suffers from the unreasonable charge. Take the
case of grain. The farmer sells to the commission merchant.
If the rates are excessive, he gets so much less for his grain or
the purchaser from the commission merchant pays so much
more for it. The commission merchant who pays the freight
has no real interest in the charge. Of course this is not
always true, but it does apply with respect to the great ship-
ments handled by middlemen.
Finally, it is questionable under the Interstate Commerce
act whether a suit to recover back an excess 'paid above a
reasonable rate can be maintained, if the rate charged was
that fixed in the schedule filed with the commission and pub-
lished under the Interstate Commerce law.
Mr. James A. Logan and Hr. John G. Johnson filed a brief
on behalf of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and eight
other railroad companies, appellees.
Mr. Robert WV. de Forest and XE. David Willos filed a
brief on behalf of the Central Railroad Company of New
Jersey, appellee.
'MR. JUSTICE- PECKEAm, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
This case has been most ably argued by counsel both for
the Government and the railroad companies. The suit is
brought to obtain a decree declaring null and void the agree-
ment mentioned in the bill. Upon comparing that agreement
with the one set forth in the case of United States v. Trans-
Missouri Freight Association, 166 U. S. 290, the great simi-
larity between them suggests that a similar result should be
reached in the two cases. The respondents, however, object
to this, and give several reasons why this case should. not be
controlled by the other. ft is, among other things, said that
one of the questions sought to be raised in this case might
have been but was not. made in the other; that the point
therein decided, after holding that the statute applied to rail-
