HOPKINS v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORAR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 210. Argued February 28, March 1, 1898. -Decided October 24,1 698.
The Kansas City Live Stock Exchange was an unincorporated volunteer
association of men, doiiig 'business at its stock yardA, situated partly in
Kansas City, Missouri, and partly across the line separating Kansas City,
Missouri, from Kansas City, Kansas, The business of its members was to
receive individually consignments of cattle, hogs, and other live stock
from owners of the same, not only in-t he States of Missouri and Kansas,
but also in other States and Territories, and to feed such stock, and to
prepare it for the market, to dispose of the same, to receive the proceeds
thereof from the purchasers, and to pay the owners their proportion of
such proceeds, after deducting charges, expenses and advances. The
members were individually in the habit of soliciting consignments from
the owners of such stock, and of making them advances thereon. The
rules of the association forbade members from buying live stock from a
commission merchant in Kansas City, not a member of the exchange.
They also fixed-the commission for selling such live stock, prohibited the
employment of agents to solicit consignments except upon a stipulated
salary, and forbade the sending of prepaid telegrams or telephone mes-
sages, with information as to the condition of the markets. ,It- was also
provided that no member should transact business with any person vio-

lating the rules and regulations, or with an expelled or suspended mem-
ber after notice of such violation. Held, that the situation of the yards,
partly in Kansas and partly in Missouri, was a fact without any weight;
that such business or occupation of the several members of the associa-
tion was not interstate commerce, within the meaning of the act of July
2, 1890, c. 647, "to protect trade and commerce against unlawful re-
straints and monopolies;" and that that act does not cover, and was not
intended to cover, such kind of agreements.
THIS suit was commenced by'the United States attorney for
the District of Kansas, acting under the direction and by the
authority of the Attorney General of the United States,
.against Henry Hopkins and the other defendants, residents
of the State of Kansas and members of a voluntary unin-
corporated association, known and designated as the Kansas
City Live Stock Exchange. The purpose of the action is to
obtain the dissolution of the exchange, and to perpetually
enjoin the members from entering into or from continuing in
any combination of a like character.
As a foundation for the relief sought it was alleged in the
bill thas the members of this association, known as the Xansas
City Live Stock Exchange, have adopted articles of association,
rules and by-laws which they have agreed to be bound by;
that the business of the exchange is carried on and conducted
by a board of directors at the Kansas City stock yards, which
are situated partly in Kansas City in the State of Missouri and
partly in Kansas City in the State of Kansas, the building
owned by the stock yards company being located one half of
it in the State of Missouri and the other half in the State of
Kansas, and half of the defendants have offices and transact
business in these stock yards aiid in that part of the building
which is within the State of Kansas, and the other half in that
part of the building which is in the State of Missouri; that the
Kansas City Stock Yards Company is a corporation owning the
stock yards, where the business is done by the members of
the exchange; that substantially all the business transacted
in the matter of receiving, buying, selling and handling their
live stock at Kansas City is carried on by the defendants herein
and by the other members of the exchange as. commission
merchants, and that large numbers of the live stock, consisting

of cattle and hogs and sheep bought and sold and handled at
the stock yards by the defendants and their fellow members
in the exchange, are shipped from the States of Nebraska,
Colorado, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, and Kansas, and the Territo-
ries of Oklahoma, Arizona and New Mexico; that when this
stock is received at the stock yards it is sold by the defendants,
members of the exchange, to the various packing houses situ-
ated at Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas, and
it is also sold for shipment to the various other markets, par-
ticularly Chicago, St. Louis and New York; that vast numbers
of cattle, hogs and other live stock are received annually at
the stock yards and handled by the members of the ex-
change.
The bill also alleges that large numbers of the live stock sold
at the stock yards by the defendants are incumbered by mort-
gages thereon, executed by their owners in the various States
and Territories, which mortgages have been given to various
defendants as security for money advanced by them to the
different owners to enable them to feed and prepare the cattle
for market, and that when the live stock so mortgaged are
ready for shipment, they are sent to the defendants who have
advanced the money and received the mortgages, and on the
sale of the stock the amount of these advances and interest is
deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the cattle by the
commission merchants owning the mortgages; that ninety per
cent Qf the members of the exchange make such advances, and
that the market is largely sustained by means of the money
thus advanced to the cattle raisers by the defendants, and that
Kansas City is the only place for many miles about, which
constitutes an available market for the purchase and sale of
live stock from the large territory located in the States and
Territories already named; that it is the custom of the owners
of the cattle, many of them living in different states, and who
consign their stock to the Kansas City stock yards for sale
to draw drafts on the commission merchants to whom the live
stock is consigned, which the consignors attach to the bill of
lading issued by the carrier, and the money on these drafts is
advanced by the local banks throughout the western States
