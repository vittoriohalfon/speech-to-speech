vided that no railroad corporation or the lessees, purchasers
or managers thereof should consolidate the stock, property or
franchises of such corporation with, or lease or purchase the
works or franchises of, or in any way control, any other rail-
road corporation owning or having under its control a parallel
or competing line; nor should any officer of such corporation
act as an officer of any other railroad corporation owning or
having the control of a parallel or competing line; and the
question whether railroads were parallel or competing lines
should, when demanded by the party complainant, be de-
cided by a jury as in other civil issues. Laws, Minnesota, 1874,
p. 154.
A subsequent statute, passed March 3, 1881, provided that
any railroad corporation, either domestic or foreign, whether
organized under a general law or by virtue of a special charter,
might lease or purchase, or become owner of or control, or hold
the stock of, any other railroad corporation, when the respec-
tive railroads could be lawfully connected and operated to-
gether "so as to constitute one continuous main line, with or
without branches," ยง 1; and that any railroad corporation,
whose lines of railroad, within or without the State, might be
lawfully. connected and operated together to constitute one
continuous main line, so as to admit of the passage of trains
over them without break or interruption, "could consolidate
their stock and franchises so as to become one corporation."
ยง 2. But by the same statute it was provided that no railroad
corporation should consolidate with, lease or purchase, or in
any way become owner of, or control any other railroad cor-
poration, or any stock, franchises, rights of property thereof,
which owned or controlled" a parallel or competing line." ยง 3.

At a later date, 1899, the Legislature oJf Minnesota passed
another statute relating principally to such restraints upon
trade and commerce as interfered with competition among
those engaged therein. That statute contained these provi-
sions:
