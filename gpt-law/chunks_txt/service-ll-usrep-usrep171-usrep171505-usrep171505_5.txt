reach that class of supposed mischiefs which flow from combi-
nations., But the great bulk of the cases, probably nine tenths,
in which courts have felt called upon to say anything about
contracts in restraint of trade, has been the business transac-
tions first alluded to in which an agreement has been entered
into, not to exercise a particular calling, as where the keeper
of a well-patronized tavern sells out his establishment and
good will, and covenants not to further carry on the business.
Such agreements at the common law have been held valid or
void according to the supposed reasonableness of the cove-
nant; but, surely even when void, there was nothing about
them calling for the intervention of the criminal law. And
yet this statute bunches the valid and the void all together, and
makes them all criminal, when probably there was not the
remotest intention to make any of them criminal.
These observations, of course, fully admit that the particu-
lar agreement or combination against which this action is
aimed, would be, assuming that the act covers contracts be-
tween railroad companies, obnoxious to the penalty imposed
by the act, provided it were, in fact, in restraint of trade or
commerce between the States. That it is, in fact, in restraint
of trade or commerce must be shown before this action can
be maintained, and this is the proper subject for discussion in
this action. This question is broadly open and unaffected by
any decision. of this court, and we expect to be able to show
that the agreement is not only not in restraint of trade and
commerce, but highly beneficial to both; that Congress has
never declared, or intended to declare, it criminal, and that it
is deserving, not of judicial condemnation, but of judicial en-
couragement and approval.
Unless the act is subject to the interpretation hereinafter
maintained,' it is open to grave objection on constitutional
grounds, which will be dealt with by other counsel.
Having presented this preliminary matter, .Mr. Garter
argued the following points.
I. The court has no jurisdiction to eptertain this suit, unless
it can be found in the provisions of some statute.
The bill sets forth sirply the commission of a misdemeanor,

and an iuteniion on the part of the defendants to repeat the
offence. No principle of the public remedial law of America
or England is more fundamental than that the ordinary ad-
ministration of criminal justice by the ordinary courts of
common law, is sufficient for the repression of crime, and ex-
clusive adhesion to it necessary for the protection of the citizen.
II. The Anti-Trust act contained provisions purporting to
create a jurisdiction in equity to give relief by way of injunc-
tion; and, perhaps, the decision made by this court in the suit
of the United States v. The Ti'ans-Xisouri Freight Associa-
tion, should be regarded as a determination that the Attorney
General was at liberty in case of any violation of the provi-
sions of the act to file a bill for an injunction, although it would
seem necessary, upon familiar principles, to make out a case
for equitable interposition, in order to justify an appeal to the
equitable jurisdiction thus created. But so far as it is sought
to maintain the present action on the basis of an alleged vio-
lation of the provisions of the Interstate Commerce act, no
support can be derived from the decision above r6ferred to.
No such jurisdiction in equity is given by that act. And by
implication, at least, it is iiithheld; for in certain cases spe-
cially mentioned in sections 6 and 13, jurisdiction is expressly
given to courts of equity to grant injunctions. If it is not
given in other cases it must be taken to be for the reason that
it was not intended. "Expreesio unius est exclusio alterius."
III. A clear understanding should be had at the outset,
of the meaning of the terms with which we are dealing. The
class of contracts condemned by the Anti-Trust act is defined
by the effect they have uipon trade or commerce. They are
such, and such only, as have the effect of restraining trade or
commerce. The actual effect which the contracts have upon
trade or commerce is the material consideration which deter-
mines whether or not they are included within the class.
This may seem self-evident, and indeed is so. But the possi-
ble suggestion might be made that there is a class of contracts,
called, or named, "contracts in restraint of trade," and that
the statute relates to these irrespective of their real and true
effect. There is no foundation for such a suggestion. There

is no class of contracts known to the law by the name of con-
tracts in restraint of trade irrespective of their actual effect
upon trade. Whenever, heretofore, the point has been made
in the case of a particular contract whether it was in restraint
of trade, it has been determined by an inquiry as to its actual
effect upon trade. !o suggestion would have been indulged
that it was valid or void according as it might, or might not,
be called or styled a contract in restraint of trade.
Moreover we are dealing with the criminal law, which never
classes acts and makes them punishable under arbitrary names,
without regard to their supposed effects, as being actually
mischievous or otherwise. This would be putting innocence
on a par with guilt.
IV. There seems to be no room for doubt concerning the
meaning of the term "in restraint of trade or commerce."
To restrain is to hold back, to check, to prevent, and thus to
diminish. It is injury to trade or commerce which the act
is aimed to prevent. Unless, therefore, a contract injures and
thus diminishes, or tends to diminish, trade or commerce, it
cannot be deemed as in restraint of trade or commerce.
V. The agreement under which The Joint Traffic Association
was formed, and the carrying out of which is sought to be
enjoined, is not a contract in restraint of trade or commerce
within the meaning of the act of July 2, 1890.
[Over one hundred pages of appellant's brief are taken up
with the discussion of this point. The following synopsis of
its reasoning was filed by counsel.]
The bulk of the whole discussion, so far as respects the
Anti-Trust act, is contained under this Fifth Point, and the line
of argument pursued is substantially as follows: (1) That
no restraint is directly, or in terms, imposed upon trade or
commerce; that all the members of the association will, as the
agreement assumes, continue in business, doing the utmost
they can, and in competition with each other; that whatever
restraint is imposed by it is imposed simply upon a single
feature of this competition; that, competition and trade not
being identical with each other, a restraint upon competition
is not necessarily a restraint upon trade. It is admitted, how-
