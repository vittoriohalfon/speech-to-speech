But a general restraint of trade has. often resulted from
combvnatwns formed for the purpose of controlling prices by
destroying the opportunity of buyers and sellers to deal with
each other upon the basis of fair, open, free competition.
-Combinations of this character have frequently been the
-subject of judicial scrutiny, and have always been condemned
as illegal because of their necessary tendency to restrain trade.
Such combinations are against common right and are crimes
against the public. To some of the cases of that character it
will be well to refer.
In Mor's Runu CoalCo. v Barclay Coal Co., 68 Penn. St.
1/73, 181, 186, 187, the principal question was as to the
validity of a contract made between five coal corporations of
Pennsylvania, by which they divided between themselves two
-coal regions of which they had the control. The referee in
the case found that those companies acquired under their
arrangement the power to control the entire market for bitu-
minous coal in the northern part of the State, and their com-
bination was, therefore, a restraint upon trade and against
public policy In response to the suggestion that the real
purpose of the combination was to lessen expenses, to advance
the quality of coal, and to deliver it m the markets intended
to be supplied in the best order to the consumer, the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania said "This is denied by the defend-
.ants, but it seems to us it is immaterial whether these posi-
tions are sustained or not. Admitting their correctness, it
-does not follow that these advantages redeem the contract
from the obnoxious effects so strikingly presented by the
referee. The important fact is that these companies control
this immense coal field, that it is -the great source of supply
-of bituminous coal to the State of New York and large terri-
tories westward, that by this contract they control the price
of coal in this extensive market, and make it bring sums it
would not command if left to the natural laws of trade, that
.it concerns an article of prime necessity for many uses, that
its operation is general in this large region, and affects all
-who use coal as a fuel, and this is accomplished by a combma-
tion of all the companies engaged in this branch of business

in the large region where they operate. The combination is-
wide in scope, general in its influence, and injurious in effects.
These being its features, the contract is against public policy,
illegal, and therefore void." Again, in the same case "The
effects produced on the public interests lead to the considera-
tion of another feature of great weight in determining the
illegality of the contract, to wit, the combination resorted to
by these five companies. Singly each might have suspended
deliveries and sales of coal to suit its own interests, and might.
have raised the price, even though this might have been detri-
mental to the public interest. There is a certain freedom
which must be allowed to every one in the management of his
own affairs. When competition is left free, individual error
or folly will generally find a correction in the conduct of
others. But here is a combination of all the companies oper
ating in the B]ossburg and Barclay mining regions, and
controlling their entire productions. They have combined
together to govern the supply and the price of coal in all the
markets from the Hudson to the Mississippi rivers, and from
Pennsylvania to the lakes. This combination has a power in
its confederated form which no individual action can confer.
The public interest must succumb to it, for it has left no.
competition free to correct its baleful influence. When the
supply of coal is suspended the demand for it becomes import-
unate, and prices must rise. Or if the supply goes forward,
the price fixed by the confederates must accompany it. The
domestic hearth, the furnaces of the iron master, and the fires
of the manufacturer, all feel the restraint, while many depend-
ent hands are paralyzed and hungry mouths are stinted. The
influence of a lack of supply or a rise in the price of an article
of such prime necessity cannot be measured. It permeates
the entire mass of community, and leaves few of its members
untouched by its withering blight. Such a combination is
more than a contract, it is an offence. II take it,' said
Gibson, J., ' a combination is criminal whenever the act to be
done has a necessary tendency to prejudice the public or to
oppress individuals, by unjustly subjecting them to the power
of the confederates, and giving effect to the purpose of the

latter, whether of extortion or of mischief.' Commonwealth
v Carlisle, Brightly, (Penn.,) 40. In all such combinations
where the purpose is injurious or unlawful, the gist of the
offence is the conspiracy Men can often do by the combina-
tion of many what severally no one could accomplish, and
even what when done by one would be innocent." "There is
a potency in numbers when combined, which the law cannot
overlook, where injury is the consequence."
Tins case in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was cited
with approval in Arnot v Pttston & Elmzra Coal Co., 68
N. Y 558, 565, which involved the validity of a contract be-
tween two coal companies, the object and effect of which was
to give one of them the monopoly of the trade in coal in a par-
ticular region, by which the price of that commodity could be
artifically enhanced. The Court of Appeals of New York held
that "a combination to effect such a purpose is inimical to the
interests of the public, and that all contracts designed to effect
such an end are contrary to public policy, and therefore illegal.
If they should be sustained, the prices of articles of
pure necessity, such as coal, flour and other indispensable com-
modities, might be artificially raised to a ruinous extent far
exceeding any naturally resulting from the proportion between
supply and demand. No illustration of the mischief of such
contracts is perhaps more apt than a monopoly of anthracite
coal, the region of the production of which is known to be
limited." See also Hooker v JFandewater,4 Demo, 351, 352;
Stanton v Allen, 5 Denio, 434, Saratoga Bank v King, 44
N. Y 87.
In Central Ohio Salt Co. v Guthre, 35 Ohio St. 666, 672,
the principal question was as to the legality of an association
of substantially all the manufacturers of salt in a large salt
producing territory After adverting to the rule that con-
tracts m general restraint of trade are against public policy,
and to the agreement there in question, it was said "Public
policy, unquestionably, favors competition in trade to the end
that its commodities may be afforded to the consumer as
cheaply as possible, and is opposed to monopolies, which tend
to advance market prices, to the injury of the general public.
