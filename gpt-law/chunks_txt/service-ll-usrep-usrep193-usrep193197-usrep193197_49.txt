against which the public interest had no protection." Again,
in People v. Chicago Gas Trust Co., 130 Illinois, 268, 297, which
involved the validity of the organization of a gas corporation
which obtained a monopoly in the business of furnishing illum-
inating gas in the city of Chicago by buying the stock of four
other gas companies, it was said: "Of what avail is it that any
number of gas companies may be formed under the general
incorporation law, if a giant trust company can be clothed with
the power of buying up and holding the stock and property of
such companies, and, through the control thereby attained, can
direct all their operations and weld them into one huge com-
bination?" To the same effect are cases almost too nu-
merous to be cited. But among them we refer to Richardson
v. Buhl, 77 Michigan, 632, which was the case of the organi-
zation of a corporation in Connecticut to unite in one cor-
poration all the match manufacturers in the United States,
and thus to obtain control of the business of manufacturing
matches; Santa Clara Mill & Lumber Co. v. Hayes, 76 Cali-
fornia, 387, 390, which was the case of a combination among
manufacturers of lumber, by which it could control the business
in certain localities; and India Bagging Association v. Kock, 14
La. Ann. 168, which was the case of a combination among
various commercial firms to control the prices of bagging used
by cotton planters.
The cases, just cited, it is true, relate to the domestic com-
merce of the States. But they serve to show the authority
which the States possess to guard the public against combina-
tions that repress individual enterprise and interfere with the
operation of the natural laws of competition among those
engaged in trade within their limits. They serve also to give
point to the declaration of this court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9
Wheat. 1, 197-a principle never modified by any subsequent
decision-that, subject to the limitations imposed by the Con-
stitution upon the exercise of the powers granted by that
instrument, "the power over commerce with foreign nations
and among the several States is vested in Congress as absolutely

as it would be in a single government having in its constitution
the same restrictions on the exercise of power as are found in
the Constitution of the United States." Is there, then, any
escape from the conclusion that, subject only to such restric-
tions, the power of Congress over interstate and international
commerce is as full and complete as is the power of any State
over its domestic commerce? If a State may strike down
combinations that restrain its domestic commerce by destroying
free competition among those engaged in such commerce, what
power, except that of Congress, is competent to protect the
freedom of interstate and international commerce when assailed
by a combination that restrains such commerce by stifling
competition among those engaged in it?
Now, the court is asked to adjudge that, if held to embrace
the case before us, the Anti-Trust Act is repugnant to the
Constitution of the United States. In this view we are unable
to concur. The contention of the defendants could not be
sustained without, in effect, overruling the ptior decisions of
this court as to the scope and validity of the Anti-Trust Act.
If, as the court has held, Congress can strike down a combina-
tion between private persons or private corporations that
restrains trade among the States in iron pipe (as in Addyston
Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States), or in tiles, grates and nmantels
(as in Montague v. Lowry), surely it ought not to be doubted
that Congress has power to declare illegal a combination that
restrains commerce among the States, and with foreign nations,
as carried on over the lines of competing railroad companies
exercising public franchises, and engaged in such commerce.
We cannot agree that Congress may strike down combinations
among manufacturers and dealers in iron pipe, tiles, grates and
mantels that testrain commerce among the States in such
articles, but may not strike down combinations among stock-
holders of competing railroad carriers, which restrain com-
merce as involved in the transportation of passengers and
property among the several States. If private parties may
not, by combination among themselves, restrain interstate

and international commerce in violation of an act of Congress,
much less can such restraint be tolerated when imposed or
attempted to be imposed upon commerce as carried -on over
public highways. Indeed, if the contentions of the defendants
are sound why may not all the railway companies in the United
States, that are engaged, under state charters, in interstate
and international commerce, enter into a combination such
as the one here in question, and by the device of a holding
corporation obtain the absolute control throughout the entire
country of rates for passengers and freight, beyond the power'
of Congress to protect the public against their exactions? The
argument in behalf of the defendants necessarily leads to such
results, and places Congress, although invested by the people
of the United States with full authority to regulate interstate
and international commerce, in a condition of utter helplessness,
so far as the protection of the public against such combinations
is concerned.
Will it be said that Congress can meet such emergencies by
prescribing the rates by which interstate carriers shall be
governed in the transportation of freight and passengers? If
Congress has the power to fix such rates-and upon that ques-
tion we express no opinion-it does not choose to exercise its
power in that way or to that extent. It has, all will agree, a
large discretion as to the means to be employed in the exercise
of any power granted to it. For the present, it has determined
to go no farther than to protect the freedom of commerce
among the States and with foreign states by declaring illegal
all contracts, combinations, conspiracies or monopolies in re-
straint of such commerce, and make it a public offence to violate
the rule thus prescribed. How much further it may go, we do
not now say. We need only at this time considerw*hether it
has exceeded its powers in enacting the statute here in questi6n.
Assuming, without further discussion, that the 'cas6 before'
us is within the terms of the act, and that the act is not in excess
of the powers of Congress, we recur to the question, how far'
may the courts go in reaching and suppressing the combination'
