nation by the few against the interest of the many and to the
detriment of freedom. The construction now given, I think,
strikes down the interest of the many to the advantage and
benefit of the few. It has been held in a case involving a
combination among workingmen, that such combinations are
embraced in the act of Congress in question, and this view
was not doubted by this court. In re Debs, 64 Fed. Rep. 724,
745-755; 158 U. S. 564. The interpretation of the statute,
therefore, which holds that reasonable agreements are within
its purview, makes it embrace every peaceable organization or
combination of the laborer to benefit his condition either by
obtaining an increase of wages or diminution of the hours
of labor. Combinations among labor for this purpose were
treated as illegal under the construction of the law, which in-
cluded reasonable contracts within the doctrine of the invalid-
ity of contract or combinations in restraint of trade, and they
were only held not to be embraced within that doctrine either
by statutory exemption therefrom or by the progress which
made reason the controlling factor on the subject. It follows
that the construction which reads the rule of reason out of the
statute embraces within its inhibition every contract or com-
bination by which workingmen seek to peaceably better their
condition. It is therefore, as I see it, absolutely true to say
that the construction now adopted which works out such re-
sults not only frustrates the plain purpose intended to be
accomplished by Congress, but also makes the statute tend to
an end never contemplated, and against the accomplishment
of which its provisions were enacted.
But conceding for the sake of argument that the words
every contract in restraint of trade," as used in the act of
Congress in question, prohibits all such contracts however
reasonable they may be, and therefore that all that great body
of contracts which are commonly entered into between indi-
viduals or corporations and which promote and develop trade,
and which have been heretofore considered as lawful, are no
longer such; and conceding also that agreements entered into
by associations of workingmen to peaceably better their con-
dition either by obtaining an increase or preventing a decrease

of wages, or by securing a reduction in the hours of labor, or
for mutually protecting each other from unjust discharge, or
for other reasqnable purposes, have become unlawful, it re-
mains to consider whether the provisions of the act of 1890
were intended to apply to agreements made between carriers
for the purpose of classifying the freight to be by them carried,
or preventing secret cutting of the published rates; in other
words, whether the terms of the statute were intended to
apply to contracts between carriers entered into for the pur-
pose of securing fairness in their dealings with each other and
tending to protect the public against improper discrimination
and sudden changes in rates. To answer this question involves
deciding whether the act here relied upon was intended to ab-
rogate the provisions of the act of Congress of the 4th of Feb-
ruary, 1887, and the amendments thereto, commonly known
as the Interstate Commerce Act. The question is not whether
railway companies may not violate the terms of the statute of
1890 if they do acts which it forbids and punishes, but whether
that statute was intended to abrogate the power of railway
companies to make contracts with each other which are either
expressly sanctioned by the Interstate Commerce Act or the
right to make which arises by reasonable implication from the
terms of that act; that is to say, not whether the act of 1890
is not operative upon all persons and corporations, but whether,
being so generally operative, it was intended to forbid, as in re-
straint of trade, all contracts on the subjects embraced within
and controlled by the interstate commerce law. The statute,
commonly known as the Interstate Commerce Act, was a spe-
cial act, and it was intended to regulate interstate commerce
transported by railway carriers. All its provisions directly
and expressly related to this subject. The act of 1890, on the
contrary, is a general law, not referring specifically to carriers
of interstate commerce. The rule is that a general will not
be held to repeal a special statute unless there be a clear im-
plication unavoidably resulting from the general law that it
was the intention that the provisions of the general law should
cover the subject-matter previously, expressly and specifically
provided for by particular legislation. The doctrine on this

subject is thus stated in Ex parte Crow Dog, 109 U. S. 556,
570:
"'The general principle to be applied,'said Bovill, C. J., in
Thorpe v. Adams, L. R. 6 C. P. 135, 'to the construction of
acts of Parliament, is that a general act is not to be construed
to repeal a previous particular act, unless there is some express
reference to the previous legislation on the subject, or unless
there is a necessary inconsistency in the two acts standing
together.' ' And the reason is,' said Wood, V. C., in Fitzgerald
v. Champenys, 30 L. J. N. S. Eq. 782; 2 Johns. & Hem. 31-54,
'that the legislature, having had its attention directed to a
special subject, and having observed all the circumstances of
the case and provided for them, does not intend by a general
enactment afterward to derogate from its own act when it
makes no special mention of its intention so to do.' "
These principles thus announced are treated as elementary
by the text writers. Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes,
§ 223; Sedgwick on Statutory Construction, §§ 157, 158;
Sutherland on Statutory Construction, § 157.
Does, therefore, the implication irresistibly arise that Con-
gress intended in the act of 1890 to abrogate, in whole or in
part, the provisions of the act of 1887, regulating interstate
commerce? It seems to me that the nature of the two enact-
ments clearly demonstrates that there was no such intention.
The act to regulate interstate commerce expressed the purpose
of Congress to deal with a complex and particular subject
which, from its very nature, required special legislation. That
act was the initiation of a policy by Congress looking to the
development and working out of a harmonious system to regu-
late the highly important subject of interstate transportation.
Conceding arguendo that the debates which took place at
the time of the passage of the act of 1890 may not be resorted
to as a means of interpreting its text, yet a review of the pro-
ceedings connected with the passage of the act of July 2, 1890,
through the two houses of Congress, it seems to me, leaves no
room for question that the act was not designed to cover the
particular subjects which had been theretofore specially regu-
lated by provisions of the interstate commerce law.
