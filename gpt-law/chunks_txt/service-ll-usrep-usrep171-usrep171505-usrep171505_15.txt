valuable plant cannot be withdrawn, nor can labor skilled
in one industry be readily shifted to another. Both manufac-
turers and workingmen are subject to the contingencies of
competition. The establishment of a new plant with modern
improvements may destroy some old one, in which both have
virtually risked their all. There are sections where a number
of years ago it was profitable to make iron out of local ores.
Millions of dollars were invested in furnaces. Workingmen
skilled in iron-making settled there, and with their earnings
bought property and built homes. Subsequently, in other
sections more accessible to the markets, with cheaper ores,
modern furnaces were erected and cheaper iron began to be
made. The old furnaces could not meet the competition of
the new. They had to be abandoned. Was it possible to
withdraw the capital invested in them? N.ot at all. It was
lost. The workingmen,. too, suffered. They were thrown out
of work, ran up debts, lost their homes.'
Why are not men who put, their capital or skill into a
manufacturing plant just as much entitled to protection
against ruinous competition as those who put their money or
skill in a transportation plant? Why should the railroads be
singled out from all the great interests of this country, and
alone be authorized to combine and prevent competition and
keep up prices?
Competition drives the weak to the wall, the fittest survive,
but the greatest good to the greatest number results. The
opening of new mines, the construction of new plants, the
establishment of industries with improved methods of produc-
tion and greater natural advantages, lower the cost of produc-
tion of the commodity to the benefit of the public, but the
person or corporation or region which cannot lower its cost of
production to meet the new competition must suffer. Under
competition the most improved plant, the best trained labor,
the most economical management, the wisest business saga-
city and foresight, is not only encouraged but demanded for
success.
The best railroad, the one constructed and equipped and
managed in the best way, will get the bulk of the competitive

business, and it ought to. It can afford to carry the traffic at
lower rates than the poorer roads, and it ought to be allowed
to, in the public interest. The poorer roads can get the busi-
ness by putting themselves in shape to do the business. Roads
equally fitted to do the work will naturally divide the competi-
tive business in equitable proportions. Competition for traffic
by improved service and lower rates will result, naturally, not
in ruining the roads, but in building them. up. Under com-
petition, the best road fixes the rate; under combination, the
poorest road. Is it just to make the public pay rates from
Chicago to the East fixed by the poorest system protected by
the Joint Traffic agreement?
V. It is contended there is no restraint on trade, because
the railways still exist with all their facilities for transporta-
tion, ready and willing to serve the public, and with no in-
ducement for service weakened; that competition in every
desirable aspect remains, the railroads being permitted to
compete, but compelled to do it openly, under the provision
that a deviation from the association rate cannot be made
except by resolution of the board of a member and after
thirty days' notice to the managers.
It is true the railways exist with their original facilities,
but the inducement for improvement by cheaper methods of
transportation is weakened, the motive for competition re-
moved, the means of competition destroyed, and competition
itself absolutely forbidden. The natural result of preventing
competition is to keep up rates. An excess in rates over what
would obtain under competition amounts in effect to a tax on
the things transported. This operates as a burden upon com-
merce, and a restraint of trade.
If a State should levy a tax on goods transported through
it, this court would hold such an act unconstitutional, because
it laid a burden upon interstate commerce. Moreover, to in-
crease rates, and maintain them at a point above what would
obtain under competition decreases the business of railroads
but enhances the cost of it, and thus restrains trade or com-
merce. Lower rates mean more traffic, both freight and
passenger. Higher rates mean less traffic. It may be to the

interest of the railroads to increase the rates and lessen the
traffic. The profits may be as much or more, but it is done
at the expense of the public and to the restraint of trade.
VI. It is insisted that rates must be stable, not subject to
change; that a manufacturer cannot safely make goods nor a
dealer buy them unless he knows the rates for transporting
them to market, and may rely upon these rates continuing;
therefore agreements for maintaining rates at a fixed point
should be encouraged.
It is obvious that the manufacturer or dealer must not only
take into account the rates he will have to pay to market, but
the rates his competitors from every quarter, by land and
water, will have to pay. It is impracticable to attain a cast-
iron uniformity of this kind, and neither the Interstate Com-
merce law nor the Joint Traffic agreement attempts it.
Moreover, the agreement does not assume to prevent a change
of rates. It virtually takes the power to change from the
companies, but gives it to the managers of the association.
For natural it substitutes arbitrary change. The protest
against any change in rates is a protest against progress.
The history of railroads shows a constant tendency towards
cheaper rates. This has resulted from improvements forced
by competition. The interest of the public lies not in main-
taining but in reducing rates, and to effect such reduction
competition is essential.
VII. Uniformity in rates is declared to be essential, and
it is urged that the provisions of the Interstate Commerce law
favoring uniformity cannot be enforced except by suppressing
competition through this agreement; and, to illustrate the
need of uniformity, it is said that without it an industry in
Michigan equidistant from market with a similar industry in
Indiana might be wiped out of existence by reduced rates
in favor of the Indiana industry.
But neither the Interstate Commerce act nor this agree-
ment would prevent the alleged injustice suggested. The
case instanced involves a reduction in rates on local traffic,
and the agreement only applies to competitive traffic. There
is nothing in the agreement to prevent any member of the
