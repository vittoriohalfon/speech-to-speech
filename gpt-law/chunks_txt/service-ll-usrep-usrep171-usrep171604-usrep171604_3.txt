and verbal agreements; that no embargo was placed upon any
one purchasing or desiring to purchase cattle at the yards, but
a free and open market was offered to all buyers and sellers;
that the members of the organization were engaged in the
business of buying and selling cattle on the market, and were
competitors among and against each other; that their organi-
zation did not restrain or interfere with interstate or local
commerce, and the members did not monopolize or attempt to
monopolize the business of buying and selling cattle at Kansas
City, nor did the organization in any manner tend to limit or
decrease the number of cattle marketed at Kansas City, but that
it had the contrary effect; that about eighty-five per cent of the
total receipts for the years 1895, 1896 and 1897 at the Kansas
City market of cattle had been billed to the Kansas City
market alone for purposes of sale there.
Other affidavits were presented to the same effect. Also
the affidavit of the president of the exchange. The president
denied all allegations in relation to conspiracies to prevent other
persons than members of the exchange from buying and sell-
ing cattle upon the Kansas City market, and on the contrary
alleged that in buying cattle the defendants were in competi-..
tion with each other, with the representative buyers of all the
packing houses, with the representatives of the various com-
mission merchants who- buy constantly on orders from a
distance, and with others who buy on orders on their own ac-
count, none of whom .are members of the exchange, and that
with these various classes of buyers the defendants constantly
deal, and that. in selling cattle they compete with each other
and with shippers and commission merchants offering stock
for sale on the market; that the business in which these
defendants are engaged is that of buying and selling cattle
known as "stockers and feeders;" that the business is purely
local to that market; that the defendants do not deal in
quarantine cattle subject to government inspection or cattle
shipped through to other markets, with or without the privi-
lege of the Kansas City market, nor in fat cattle sold on the
local market shipped to other States or to foreign countries;
that except in rare instances. both purchases and sales made

by the defendants are made from and to persons not members
of the exchange, and that in the judgment of the president
about ninety-nine per cent of the transactions by the defend-
ants are with persons not members of the exchange.
A copy of the articles of association is annexed to the affi-
davit, which contains the following preamble:

each other, and give dignity and responsibility to yard traders,
have associated ourselves together under the name of Traders'
Live Stock Exchange, and, hereby agree, each with the other,
that we will faithfully observe and be bound by the following
rules and by-laws and such new rules, additions or amendments
as may from time to time be adopted in conformity with the
provisions thereof from the date of organization."

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.
MR. JUSTICE PEcYXH, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
There is really no dispute in regard to the facts in the case.
Although the bill contains various allegations in regard to
conspiracies, agreements and combinations in restraint of
trade and in violation of the Federal statute, yet there is
no evidence of any act on the part of the defendants pre-
-venting access to the yards or preventing purchases and sales
of cattle by any one, other than as such sales may be prevented
by the mere refusal on the part of the defendants as "yard
traders" to do business with those who are also yard traders,
but are not members of the exchange, or with commission mer-
chants where such commission merchants themselves do business
with yard traders who are not members of the exchange. In
other words, there is no evidence and really no charge against
the defendants that they have done anything other than to
form this exchange and adopt and eAforce the rules mentioned
above, and the question is whether by their adoption and by
peacefully carrying them out without threats and without
violence, but by the mere refusal to do business with those
who will not respect their rules, there is a violation of the
Federal statute.
This case differs from that of Hoplins v. United States,
stypra, in the fact that these defendants are themselves pur-
chasers of cattle on the market, while the defendants in the
Hopkins case were only commission merchants who sold the
cattle upon commission as a compensation for their services.
Counsel for the Government assert that any agreement or
combination among buyers of cattle coming from other States,
of the nature of the by-laws in qfiestion, is an agreement or
combination in restraint of interstate trade or commerce.
The facts first set forth in the complainants' bill upon which
to base the claim that the business of defendants is interstate
commerce, we have already decided in the Hopkins case to be
immaterial. The particular situation of the yards, partly in
Kansas and partly in Missouri, we there held was a fact with-
out any weigh, and one which did not make businegs inter-
