FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v. TICOR TITLE
INSURANCE CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 91-72. Argued January 13, 1992-Decided June 12, 1992
Petitioner Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint
charging respondent title insurance companies with horizontal price
fixing in setting fees for title searches and examinations in violation of
ยง 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. In each of the four
States at issue-Connecticut, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Montana-uni-
form rates were established by a rating bureau licensed by the State
and authorized to establish joint rates for its members. Rate filings
were made to the state insurance office and became effective unless the
State rejected them within a specified period. The Administrative Law
Judge held, inter alia, that the rates had been fixed in all four States,
but that, in Wisconsin and Montana, respondents' anticompetitive activi-
ties were entitled to state-action immunity, as contemplated in Parker
v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, and its progeny. Under this doctrine, a state
law or regulatory scheme can be the basis for antitrust immunity if
the State (1) has articulated a clear and affirmative policy to allow the
anticompetitive conduct and (2) provides active supervision of anti-
competitive conduct undertaken by private actors. California Retail
Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, 105. The
Commission, which conceded that the first part of the test was met, held
on review that none of the States had conducted sufficient supervi-
sion to warrant immunity. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that
the existence of a state regulatory program, if staffed, funded, and em-
powered by law, satisfied the active supervision requirement. Thus, it
concluded, respondents' conduct in all the States was entitled to state-
action immunity.
Held:
1. State-action immunity is not available under the regulatory
schemes in Montana and Wisconsin. Pp. 632-640.
(a) Principles of federalism require that federal antitrust laws be
subject to supersession by state regulatory programs. Parker,s upra,
at 350-352; Midcal, supra; Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94. Midcal's
two-part test confirms that States may not confer antitrust immunity
on private persons by fiat. Actual state involvement is the precondition
for immunity, which is conferred out of respect for the State's ongoing

regulation, not the economics of price restraint. The purpose of the
active supervision inquiry is to determine whether the State has exer-
cised sufficient independent judgment and control so that the details of
the rates or prices have been established as a product of deliberate
state intervention. Although this immunity doctrine was developed in
actions brought under the Sherman Act, the issue whether it applies to
Commission action under the Federal Trade Commission Act need not
be determined, since the Commission does not assert any superior pre-
emption authority here. Pp. 632-635.
(b) Wisconsin, Montana, and 34 other States correctly contend
that a broad interpretation of state-action immunity would not serve
their best interests. The doctrine would impede, rather than advance,
the States' freedom of action if it required them to act in the shadow of
such immunity whenever they entered the realm of economic regulation.
Insistence on real compliance with both parts of the Midcal test serves
to make clear that the States are responsible for only the price fixing
they have sanctioned and undertaken to control. Respondents' conten-
tion that such concerns are better addressed by the first part of the
Midcal test misapprehends the close relation between Midcal's two
elements, which are both directed at ensuring that particular anticom-
petitive mechanisms operate because of a deliberate and intended state
policy. A clear policy statement ensures only that the State did not act
through inadvertence, not that the State approved the anticompetitive
conduct. Sole reliance on the clear articulation requirement would not
allow the States sufficient regulatory flexibility. Pp. 635-637.
(c) Where prices or rates are initially set by private parties, subject
to veto only if the State chooses, the party claiming the immunity must
show that state officials have undertaken the necessary steps to deter-
mine the specifics of the price-fixing or ratesetting scheme. The mere
potential for state supervision is not an adequate substitute for the
State's decision. Thus, the standard relied on by the Court of Appeals
in this case is insufficient to establish the requisite level of active super-
vision. The Commission's findings of fact demonstrate that the poten-
tial for state supervision was not realized in either Wisconsin or Mon-
tana. While most rate filings were checked for mathematical accuracy,
some were unchecked altogether. Moreover, one rate filing became
effective in Montana despite the rating bureau's failure to provide re-
quested information, and additional information was provided in Wis-
consin after seven years, during which time another rate filing remained
in effect. Absent active supervision, there can be no state-action im-
munity for what were otherwise private price-fixing arrangements.
And state judicial review cannot fill the void. See Patrick, supra, at
103-105. This Court's decision in Southern Motor CarriersR ate Con-

ference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U. S. 48, which involved a similar
negative option regime, is not to the contrary, since it involved the ques-
tion whether the first part of the Midcal test was met. This case in-
volves horizontal price fixing under a vague imprimatur in form and
agency inaction in fact, and it should be read in light of the gravity of
the antitrust offense, the involvement of private actors throughout, and
the clear absence of state supervision. Pp. 637-640.
2. The Court of Appeals should have the opportunity to reexamine
its determinations with respect to Connecticut and Arizona in order to
address whether it accorded proper deference to the Commission's fac-
tual findings as to the extent of state supervision in those States. P. 640.
