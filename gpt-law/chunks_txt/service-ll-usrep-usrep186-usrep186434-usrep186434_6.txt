FARMERS' LOAN &c. CO. v. PENN PLATE GLASS CO. 449
Opinion of the Court.
In this view, we must ask was there any obligation resting
upon these defendants to insure by reason of the contents of
the mortgage and of the deeds under which The Penn Com-
pany now claims title? In order to determine whether there
was an obligation of this nature it must first be decided there
was such obligation on the part of the mortgagor company,
because if that company was never under any obligation to in-
sure, it is clear that the grantees subject to'the mortgage were
also free from any liability of that nature.
It is claimed that the mortgagor company became liable to
insure by reason of the provision in article tenth of the mort-
gage, or at least that it became thus liable to insure, when un-
der that provision, it was required to do so by the mortgagee.'
That portion of the article directly in question here, after pro-
viding that it should be no part of the. duty of the trustee to do
certain things therein named, continued : "Nor shall it be any
part of its duty to effect insurance against fire or other dam-
age on any portion of the mortgaged property, or to renew
any policies of insurance, or to keep itself informed or advised
as to the payment of any taxes or assessments, or to require
such payment to be made; but the trustee may in its discre-
tion do any or all of the matters and things in this paragraph
set forth or require the same to be done."
It is argued that by this language a covenant arose on the
part of the mortgagor, by which it covenanted to insure the
property if required to do so by the mortgagee. Reading the
whole of that article with the other provisions of the mortgage,
we think there is great force in the reasoning of Judge Gray
in the Circuit Court of Appeals, by. which he concludes that
there was no original obligation imposed by the mortgage on
the mortgagor to insure for the benefit of the mortgagee. But
we do not ourselves decide that no such obligation existed.
The Court of Appeals did not place its determination upon that
ground alone, but after discussing it and coming to the conclu-
sion which it did, it then proceeded to discuss the question
whether the defendant company was liable upon the assump-
tion that there rested upon the mortgagor an original obliga-
tion imposed upon it by the mortgage to insure for the benefit

of the bondholders. We will make the same assumption, and
the inquiry then arises as to the obligation of the defendants
to themselves insure for the benefit of the bondholders after
they respectively became the owners of the equity of redemp-
tion in the premises.
Kann became the purchaser under a receiver's sale ordered
by the court and pursuant to its directions, and he received
from the officer conducting that sale a deed conveying to him
the premises subject to the mortgage of the complainant. He
thus occupies the position of a purchaser at a judicial sale which
was ordered to be made subject to the lien of an existing mort-
gage upon the premises to be sold, and he made no agreement
which in terms obligated him to pay a dollar of the mortgage
or to comply with a single one of the covenants of the mort-
gagor. Whatever his obligations may have been in regard to
the mortgage or to the covenants of the mortgagor arising from
the simple fact of his taking a deed subject to that mortgage,
the obligations of his grantee are no greater than his own. The
Penn Company took the title which he had subject to the same
mortgage as in his case, and with no promise on its part, in
terms, to pay the mortgage or to insure the premises for the
benefit of any other interest than its own.
Counsel for the complainant argue that the extent of the ob-
ligation of grantees or purchasers subject to a mortgage in
Pennsylvania has always been, at the least, that by taking
such a deed the grantee impliedly agrees to indemnify the
grantor against his liability on the mortgage. Many cases are
cited by the parties on both sides in relation to this question.
In -Moore's Apeal, 88 Penn. St. 450, decided in 1879, Chief
Justice Sharswood, delivering the opinion of the court, it was
held that such a clause was a covenant of indemnity only, as
between the grantor and the grantee for the protection of the
former. Or, in other words, it was held that on taking the
land the grantee will indemnify the grantor to the extent of
the mortgage, in the same manner as if the consideration had
been paid in cash and then applied by the mortgagor at the
time. It was also held that an agreement to pay the encum-
brance might be implied from the circumstances of any particu

Jar case. In the course of his opinion the Chief Justice reviews
many prior cases in that State, and, in speaking of the words
"subject to the mortgage thereon," said:
"Why should a covenant be inferred from these words by
the vendee to the vendor to do more than protect the latter
from loss? If there is no existing personal liability in the ven-
dor by reason of his bond or promise under which he can be
compelled to pay if the mortgaged premises prove insufficient,
what reason is there that he should exact a covenant from his
vendee for the benefit of a stranger? If such personal liability
does exist why should he exact anything more than indemnity?
Surely, then, something should appear to create the inference
of such a covenant. The words 'under and subject' import no'
such thing. They import that the vendee takes the land en-
cumbered, and at most that so taking -it at an agreed considera-
tion, which includes the encumbrance, he will indemnify the
vendor to the extent of that consideration, in the same manner
as if it had been paid in cash and so applied at the time. It is
unwise to give an arbitrary, artificial meaning to words com-
monly, used in contracts and conveyances, and thus entrap
parties into engagements into which they had no reason to
suppose, in the common use of language, they were entering.
The act of assembly of June 12, 1878, Pamph. L. 205, has very
wisely provided that the grantor shall not be personally liable
unless he shall expressly assume such liability by agreement in
writing, or condition in the conveyance." -
In Blood's Executors v. Crew Levic7 Co., 1M1 Penn. St. 328,
the import of the clause "under and subject to the lien of" a
mortgage was under consideration, and it was held that an im-
plied covenant to indemnify arose from that language. It was
also held that the vendor had no right of action against the
vendee in such a deed until he had been forced to pay the mort-
gage, either in whole or in part. This was also held in a case
between the same parties, reported in the same volume (171
Penn. St.) at page 339.
