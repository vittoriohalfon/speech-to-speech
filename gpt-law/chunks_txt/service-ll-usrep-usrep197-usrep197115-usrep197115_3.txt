NATIONAL COTTON OIL CO. v'. TEXAS.
197 U. S. Argument for Plaintiff in Error.
The Supreme Court of Texas has refused to follow this
court in Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540,
nor does Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, 177 U. S. 28, support
its decision. See N. Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Cravens, 178 U. S. 389.
The right of the State to forfeit defendant's license depends
upon the conditions annexed expressly or by implication to
the grant made by the license. If the Anti-Trust Statutes were
a part of the contract and have been violated, the forfeiture
may be enforced, but if they were not, then they do not enter
into the contract at all, but are mere statutes, not contracts,
and their validity may be contested by this defendant, as well
as by an individual.
While corporations are not "citizens," within the meaning
of § 2, Art. IV, of the Federal Constitution, Paul v. Virginia,
8 Wall. 168; Blake v. McClung, 172 U. S. 239, yet they are
"persons" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment,
and may invoke that provision against the taking of their
property without due process of law, and the denial of the
equal protection of the laws, Santa Clara County v. Southern
Pacific Ry. Co., 118 U. S. 394; Covington Turnpike Co. v.
Sandford, 164 U. S. 578, 592; Smythe v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466,
522; and this is true of a foreign corporation which has ob-
tained a license to transact business in the State.
A state statute which violates the Federal Constitution is
not binding upon a corporation nor is it valid in any respect.
Dayton C. & I. Co. v. Barton, 183 U. S. 28; W. W. Cargill Co.
v. Minnesota, 180 U. S. 452; Cable v. U. S. Life Ins. Co., 191
U. S. 288; O'Brien v. Wheelock, 184 U. S. 450; South Ottawa
v. Perkins, 94 U. S. 267; Doyle v.' Insurance Co., 94 U. S. 535,
distinguished, and see Baron v. Burnside, 121 U. S. 186.
While state legislation has been sustained against foreign
corporations none of the cases are based on the ground that
the only remedy sought by the State is forfeiture of corporate
grants. Fidelity Mutual Life Assn. v. Mettler, 185 11. S. 308;
Iowa ins. Co. v. Lewis, 187 U. S. 335; Farmers &c. Ins. Co. v.

ville Iron Co. v. Harbison, 183 U. S. '13; Dayton Coal & Iron
Co. v. Barton, 183 U. S. 23; Blake v. McClung, 172 U. S. 239;

While the power of the State to impose terms upon a foreign
corporation seeking admission was distinctly recognized yet
these cases are clearly distinguished from Connolly v. Union
Sewer Pipe Co., and other cases in which this court has pro-
tected foreign corporations against unconstitutional state legis-
lation.
The contention that a corporation may be bound by a stat-
ute which violates the Federal Constitution is unsound, danger-
ous and contrary to many decisions of this court. Insurance
Company v. French, 18 How. 404; Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20
Wall. 445; Barron v. Burnside, 121 U. S. 186; Southern Pacific
Co. v. Denton, 146 U. S. 202; Barrow Steamship Co. v. Kane,
170 U. S. 100, 111. See also Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v.
Becker, 32 Fed. Rep. 849; Chattanooga R. & C. R. Co. v. Evans,
66 Fed. Rep. 809, 814; Reimers v. Seatco Mfg. Co., 70 Fed.
Rep. 573. While these cases involved statutes which re-
quired foreign corporations, as one of the conditions imposed
in granting the license, to refrain from removing such suits
as might be brought against them, into, the courts of the
United States, that does not in any wise affect the principle.
That provision is no more sacred than any other.
All of the Anti-Trust Laws of Texas are also in contravention
of the Fourteenth Amendment for the reason that they nec-
essarily deprive persons of liberty and property without due
process of law, in that they deny all persons the right to make
any contract, in the ordinary course of business and on ordi-
nary business subjects, which tends to restrict competition
or tra(de, commerce or business, or in any manner to affect
prices. 2 Idd dy on Comb. §§ 904 et seq.

NATIONAL COTTON OIL CO. v. TEXAS.
197 U. S. Argument for Plaintiff in Error.
The right of all persons to combine for the purpose of carry-
ing on an ordinary business in the familiar dnd ordinary
methods sanctioned by the continuous commercial usages of
the Anglo-Saxon race and by the common law is one of the
liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and, as
the corporation is in the State without conditions, to inpair
this liberty and the ability to conduct a merchandising or other
business in the ordinary way, through the making of pur-
chases and sales and the fixing of prices, is clearly to work a
deprivation of property without due process of law, and to
impair the well recognized liberty of contract, involved in the
acquiring, using and dealing with property, protected by that
amendment to the Federal Constitution. L. S. & Mich. So.

Act of 1899; Rev. Stat., Texas, art. 5313; Penal Code, Texas,

every partnership out of Texas. Parsons, 3d ed., 6; 1 Kent

There is no basis for the assumption that the legislature
could not have intended these results or effects, casting a
blight over all business associations- and-combinations. The
acts are plain and unambiguous in terms. Art. 9, Penal Code,
