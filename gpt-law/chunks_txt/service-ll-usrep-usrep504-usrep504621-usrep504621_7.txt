Opinion of the Court
participation, state judicial review was likewise limited.
See Patrick, 486 U. S., at 103-105.
Our decision in Southern Motor Carriers Rate Confer-
ence, Inc. v. United States, 471 U. S. 48 (1985), though it too
involved a negative option regime, is not to the contrary.
The question there was whether the first part of the Midcal
test was met, the Government's contention being that a pric-
ing policy is not an articulated one unless the practice is com-
pelled. We rejected that assertion and undertook no real
examination of the active supervision aspect of the case, for
the Government conceded that the second part of the test
had been met. Id., at 62, 66. The concession was against
the background of a District Court determination that, al-
though submitted rates could go into effect without further
state activity, the State had ordered and held ratemaking
hearings on a consistent basis, using the industry submis-
sions as the beginning point. See United States v. Southern
Motor CarriersR ate Conference, Inc., 467 F. Supp. 471, 476-
477 (ND Ga. 1979). In the case before us, of course, the
Commission concedes the first part of the Midcal require-
ment and litigates the second; and there is no finding of sub-
stantial state participation in the ratesetting scheme.
This case involves horizontal price fixing under a vague
imprimatur in form and agency inaction in fact. No anti-
trust offense is more pernicious than price fixing. FTC v.
Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U. S. 411, 434, n. 16
(1990). In this context, we decline to formulate a rule that
would lead to a finding of active state supervision where in
fact there was none. Our decision should be read in light of
the gravity of the antitrust offense, the involvement of pri-
vate actors throughout, and the clear absence of state super-
vision. We do not imply that some particular form of state
or local regulation is required to achieve ends other than
the establishment of uniform prices. Cf. Columbia v. Omni
Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365 (1991) (city billboard
zoning ordinance entitled to state-action immunity). We do

not have before us a case in which governmental actors made
unilateral decisions without participation by private actors.
Cf. Fisher v. Berkeley, 475 U. S. 260 (1986) (private actors
not liable without private action). And we do not here call
into question a regulatory regime in which sampling tech-
niques or a specified rate of return allow state regulators
to provide comprehensive supervision without complete con-
trol, or in which there was an infrequent lapse of state super-
vision. Cf. 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U. S. 335, 344,
n. 6 (1987) (a statute specifying the margin between whole-
sale and retail prices may satisfy the active supervision re-
quirement). In the circumstances of this case, however, we
conclude that the acts of respondents in the States of Mon-
tana and Wisconsin are not immune from antitrust liability.
IV
In granting certiorari we undertook to review the further
contention by the Commission that the Court of Appeals was
incorrect in disregarding the Commission's findings as to the
extent of state supervision. The parties have focused their
briefing on this question on the regulatory schemes of
Connecticut and Arizona. We think the Court of Appeals
should have the opportunity to reexamine its determinations
with respect to these latter two States in light of the views
we have expressed.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring.
The Court's standard is in my view faithful to what our
cases have said about "active supervision." On the other
hand, I think THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE O'CONNOR
are correct that this standard will be a fertile source of un-
certainty and (hence) litigation, and will produce total aban-

donment of some state programs because private individuals
will not take the chance of participating in them. That is
true, moreover, not just in the "negative option" context, but
even in a context such as that involved in Patrick v. Burget,
486 U. S. 94 (1988): Private physicians invited to participate
in a state-supervised hospital peer review system may not
know until after their participation has occurred (and indeed
until after their trial has been completed) whether the
State's supervision will be "active" enough.
I am willing to accept these consequences because I see no
alternative within the constraints of our "active supervision"
doctrine, which has not been challenged here; and because I
am skeptical about the Parkerv . Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943),
exemption for state-programmed private collusion in the
first place.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE O'CON-
NOR and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.
The Court holds today that to satisfy the "active supervi-
sion" requirement of state-action immunity from antitrust
liability, private parties acting pursuant to a regulatory
scheme enacted by a state legislature must prove that "the
State has played a substantial role in determining the spe-
cifics of the economic policy." Ante, at 635. Because this
standard is neither supported by our prior precedent nor
sound as a matter of policy, I dissent.
Immunity from antitrust liability under the state-action
doctrine was first established in Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S.
341 (1943). As noted by the majority, in Parkerw e relied
on principles of federalism in concluding that the Sherman
Act did not apply to state officials administering a regulatory
program enacted by the state legislature. We concluded
that state action is exempt from antitrust liability, because
in the Sherman Act Congress evidences no intent to "re-
strain state action or official action directed by a state." Id.,
