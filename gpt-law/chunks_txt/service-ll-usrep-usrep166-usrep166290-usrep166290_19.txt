the court rests upon that hypothesis. I commence, then, with
these two conceded propositions, one of law and the other of
fact, first, that only such contracts as unreasonably restrain
trade are violative of the general law, and, second, that the
particular contract here under consideration is reasonable, and
therefore not unlawful if the general principles of law are to
be applied to it.
The theory upon which the contract is held to be illegal is
that even though it be reasonable, and hence valid, under the
general principles of law, it is yet void, because it conflicts
with the act of Congress already referred to. Now, at the
outset, it is necessary to understand the full import of this
conclusion. As it is conceded that the contract does not un-
reasonably restrain trade, and that if it does not so unreason-
ably restrain, it is valid under the general law, the decision,
substantially, is that the act of Congress is a departure from
the general principles of law, and by its terms destroys the
right of individuals or corporations to enter into very many
reasonable contracts. But this proposition, I submit, is tan-
tamount to an assertion that the act of Congress is itself
unreasonable. The difficulty of meeting, by reasoning, a
premise of this nature is frankly conceded, for, of course,
where the fundamental proposition upon whicih the whole
contention rests is that the act of Congress is unreasonable, it
would seem conducive to no useful purpose to invoke reason
as applicable to and as controlling the construction of a stat-
ute which is admitted to be beyond the pale of reason. The
question, then, is, is the act of Congress relied on to be so
interpreted as to give it a reasonable meaning, or is it to be
construed as being unreasonable and as violative of the ele-
mentary principles of justice ?
The argument upon which it is held that the act forbids
those reasonable contracts which are universally admitted to
be legal is thus stated in the opinion of the court, and I quote
the exact language in which it is there expressed, lest in seek-
ing to epitomize I may not accurately reproduce the thought
which it conveys:
" Contracts in restraint of trade have been known and

spoken of for hundreds of years both in England andin this coun-
try, and the term includes all kinds of those contracts which
in fact restrain trade. Some of such contracts have been
held void and unenforcible in the courts by reason of their
restraint being unreasonable, while others have been held
valid because they were not of that nature. A contract may
be in restraint of trade and still be valid at. common law.
Although valid, it is nevertheless a contract in restraint of
trade, and would be so described either at common law or
elsewhere. By the simple use of the term 'contract in re-
straint of trade,' all contracts of that nature, whether valid
or otherwise, would be included, and not alone that kind of
contract which was invalid and unenforcible as being in un-
reasonable restraint of trade. When, therefore, the body of
an act pronounces as illegal every contract or combination
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States,
etc., the plain and ordinary meaning of such language is
not limited to that kind of contract alone which is in unrea
sonable restraint of trade, but all contracts are included in
such language, and no exception or limitation can be added
without placing in the act that which has been omitted by
Congress."
To state the proposition in the form in which it was ear-
nestly pressed in the argument at bar, it is as follows: Con-
gress has said every contract in restraint of trade is illegal.
When the law says every, there is no power in the courts, if
they correctly interpret and apply the statute, to substitute the
word " some" for the word " every." If Congress had meant
to forbid only restraints of trade which were unreasonable
it would have said so; instead of doing this it has said every,
and this word of universality embraces both contracts which
are reasonable and unreasonable.
Is the proposition which is thus announced by the court,
and which was thus stated at bar, well founded? is the first
question which arises for solution. I quote the title and the
first section of the act which, it is asserted, if correctly inter-
preted, destroys the right to make just and reasonable con-
tracts:

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Dissenting Opinion: White, Field, Gray, Shiras, JJ.
"An act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful
restraints and monopolies.
"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or other-
wise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among
the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared
to be illegal. Every person who shall make any such con-
tract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall
be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof,
shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars,
or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said
punishments in the discretion of the court."
Is it correct to say that at common law the words "restraint
of trade" had a generic signification which embraced all con-
tracts which restrained the freedom of trade, whether reason-
able or unreasonable, and, therefore, that all such contracts are
within the meaning of the words "every contract in restraint of
trade"? I think a brief consideration of the history and develop-
ment of the law on the subject will not only establish the inac-
curacy of this proposition, but also demonstrate that the words
"restraint of trade" embrace only contracts which unreasonably
restrain trade, and, therefore, that reasonable contracts, al-
though they, in some measure, "restrain trade," are not within
the meaning of the words. It is true that in the adjudged
cases language may be found referring to contracts in re-
straint of trade which are valid because reasonable. But this
mere form of expression, used not as a definition, does not
maintain the contention that such contracts are embraced
within the general terms every contract in restraint of trade.
The rudiments of the doctrine of contracts in restraint of trade
are found in the common law at a very early date. The first
case on the subject is reported in 6 Year Book 5, 2 Hen. V,
and is known as Dier's case. That was an action of damages
upon a bond conditioned that the defendant should not prac-
tise his trade as a dyer at a particular phlce during a limited
period, and it was held that the contract was illogal. The
principle upon which this case was decided was not described
as one forbidding contracts in restraint of trade, but was
stated to be one by which contracts restricting the liberty of
