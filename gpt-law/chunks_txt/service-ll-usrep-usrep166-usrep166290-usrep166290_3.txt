"Any wilful underbilling in weights, or billing of freight
at wrong classification, shall be considered a violation of this
agreement; and the rules and regulations of any weighing
association or inspection bureau, as established by it or as
enforced by its officers and agents, shall be considered bind-

Railroad Company, and some seventeen other railroad com-
panies, the officers of which had, it was alleged, signed the
agreement above mentioned in behalf of and for their respec-
tive companies. The bill was filed by the Government for
the purpose of having the agreement between the defendant
railroad companies set aside and declared illegal and void, and
to have the association dissolved.
It alleged that the defendant railroad corporations, signing
the agreement, were at that time and ever since had been
common carriers of all classes and kinds of freight and com-
modities which .mere commonly moved, carried and trans-
ported by railroad companies in their freight traffic, and at
all such times had been, and then were, continuously engaged
in transporting freight and commodities in the commerce,
trade and traffic which is continuously carried on among and
between the several States of the United States, and among

cation engaged in the freight traffic between and among â€¢ the

and between the States and Territories of the United States
lying westward of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers to the
Pacific Ocean, and that the construction and maintenance of
said several separate, distin'ct and competitive lines of railroad
aforesaid had been encouraged and assisted by the United
States and by the States and Territories in the region of
country aforesaid, and by the people of the said several States

curities, for the purpose of securing to the public and to the
people engaged in trade and commerce throughout the region
of country aforesaid competitive lines of transportation and
communication, and that prior to the 15th day of March,
