NORTHERN SECURITIES CO. v. UNITED STATES. 389
193 U. S. WHITE, J., The CHIEP JUSTICE, PECEHAM, HOLMES, JJ., dissenting.
"Counsel for the Government assert that any agreement
or combination among buyers of cattle coming from other
States, of the nature of the by-laws in question, is an agree-
ment or combination in restraint of interstate trade or com-
merce."
The court, however, said it did not deem it necessary to
decide whether the fact that the merchants who entered into
the agreement bought cattle in other States and shipped them
to other States, caused their business to be interstate com-
merce, because in any event the court was of opinion that the
agreement which was assailed, even if it involved interstate
commerce, was not in violation of any of the provisions of
the Anti-Trust Act.
The Anderson case was followed by Addyston Pipe & Steel
Co. v. United States, 175 U. S. 211. The case involved deciding
whether a particular combination of pipe manufacturers, look-
ing to the control of the sale and transportation of such pipe
over a large territory, embracing many States and a division
of the territory between the members of the combination, was
within the prohibitions of the Anti-Trust Act. Coming to con-
sider the subject, the court, through Mr. Justice Peckham,
analyzed the contract and pointed out its monopolistic features.
In answer to the argument that the matter complained of was
not commerce, because it related only to a sale of pipe, and
therefore was within the rule announced in the Knight and
Hopkins cases, the Knight case was approvingly reviewed,
and its doctrine in effect was reaffirmed, the court observing
(p. 240):
"The direct purpose of the combination in the Knight case
was the control of the manufacture of sugar. There was no
combination or agreement, in terms, regarding the future
disposition of the manufactured articles; nothing looking to a
transaction in the nature of interstate commerce.
"We think the case now before us involves contracts of the
nature last before mentioned, not incidentally or collaterally,

but as a direct and immediate result of the combination en-
gaged in by defendants. . . The defendants by reason
of this combination and agreement could only send their goods
out of the State in which they were manufactured for sale and
delivery in another State, upon the terms and pursuant to the
provisions of such combination. As pertinently asked by the
court below, was not this a direct restraint upon interstate
commerce in those goods?" (Italics mine.)
Having thus found that the agreement concerned interstate
commerce, because it directly purported to control the move-
ment of goods from one State to the other, and besides sought
to prohibit that movement or restrict the same to particular
individuals, it was held that the contract was, for these reasons,
within the prohibitions of the act of Congress, and was there-
fore void. I do not pause to consider the case of Montague &
Co.v . Lowry, 193 U. S. 38, decided at this term, since on the face
of the opinion it is patent that the contract directly concerned
the shipment of goods from one State to another, and this
was the sole and exclusive basis of the decision.
Now, it is submitted, that the decided cases just reviewed
demonstrate that the acquisition and ownership of stock in
competing railroads, organized under state law, by several
persons or by corporations, is not interstate commerce, and,
therefore, not subject to the control of Congress. It is, indeed,
suggested that the cases establish a contrary doctrine. This
is sought to be demonstrated by quoting passages from the
opinions separated from their context apart from the questions
which the cases involved. But as the issues which were de-
cided in the Knight, in the Pearsall,i n the Louisville and Nash-
ville case and in the Hopkins case directly exclude the signifi-
cance attributed to the passages from the opinions in those
cases relied upon, it must follow that if such passages could,
when separated from their context, have the meaning attributed
to them the-expressions would be mere obiter. And this con-
sideration renders it unnecessary for me to analyze the passages
to show that when they are read in connection with their con-

text they have not the meaning now sought to be attached to
them. But other considerations equally render it unnecessary
to particularly review the sentences relied upon. There can
be no doubt that it was expressly decided in the Knight case
that the acquisition of stock by one corporation in other cor-
porations so as to control them all was not interstate com-
merce, although the goods of the manufacturing companies whose
stock was acquiredm ight become the subject of interstate commerce.
If then the passage from the Knight case could be given the
meaning sought to be affixed to it, the result would be but to
say that that case overruled itself. And this would be the
result in the Pearsallc ase, since in that case it was decided that
the States had the power to forbid the consolidation of com-
peting railroads, even by means of the acquisition of stock.
Besides, as in the Louisville and Nashville case, immediately
following the Pearsall,i t was expressly decided that the inter-
state commerce power of Congress did not embrace such con-
solidation, and Congress, therefore, could not restrain a State
from either forbidding or permitting it to take place, it would
follow that if the sentevces in the Pearsallc ase had the import
now applied to them, that that case not only overruled itself,
but was besides overruled by the Louisville and Nashville case,
and this although the two cases were decided on the same day,
the opinions in both cases having been delivered by the same
Justice.
The same confusion and contradiction arises from separating
from their context and citing as applicable to this case passages
from the opinions in the Freight Association and Joint Traffic
cases. Those cases, as I have previously stated, related ex-
clusively to a contract admittedly involving interstate com-
merce, and it was decided that any restraint of such commerce
was forbidden by the Anti-Trust Act. Now in the Hopkins
case, decided subsequent to the Freight Association and Joint
Traffic cases, the contract considered unquestionably involved
a restraint, but, as such restraint did not concern interstate
commerce, it was held not to come within the power of Congress.
