FTC v. TICOR TITLE INS. CO.
Opinion of the Court
In Wisconsin the State Insurance Commissioner is re-
quired to examine the rating bureau at regular intervals and
authorized to reject rates through a process of hearings.
Neither has been done. The Wisconsin rating bureau made
major rate filings in 1971, 1981, and 1982. The 1971 rate
filing was approved in 1971 although supporting justification,
which had been requested by the State Insurance Commis-
sioner, was not provided until 1978. The 1981 rate filing
requested an 11 percent rate increase. The increase was
approved after the office of the Insurance Commissioner
checked the supporting data for accuracy. No one in the
agency inquired into insurer expenses, though an official
testified that substantive scrutiny would not be possible
without that inquiry. The 1982 rate increase received but a
cursory reading at the office of the Insurance Commissioner.
The supporting materials were not checked for accuracy,
though in the absence of an objection by the agency, the rate
increase went into effect. Id., at 196a-200a.
In Arizona the Insurance Director was required to exam-
ine the rating bureau at least once every five years. It was
not done. In 1980 the State Insurance Department an-
nounced a comprehensive investigation of the rating bureau.
It was not conducted. The rating bureau spent most of its
time justifying its escrow rates. Following conclusion in
1981 of a federal civil suit challenging the joint fixing of es-
crow rates, the rating bureau went out of business without
having made any major rate filings, though it had proposed
minor rate adjustments. Id., at 200a-205a.
In Montana the rating bureau made its only major rate
filing in 1983. In connection with it, a representative of the
rating bureau met with officials of the State Insurance De-
partment. He was told that the filed rates could go into
immediate effect though further profit data would have to be
provided. The ALJ found no evidence that the additional
data were furnished. Id., at 211a-214a.

Opinion of the Court
To complete the background, the ALJ observed that none
of the rating bureaus are now active. The respondents
abandoned them between 1981 and 1985 in response to nu-
merous private treble-damages suits, so by the time the
Commission filed its formal complaint in 1985, the rating bu-
reaus had been dismantled. Id., at 195a, 200a, 205a, 208a.
The ALJ held that the case is not moot, though, because
nothing would preclude respondents from resuming the
conduct challenged by the Commission. Id., at 246a-247a.
See United States v. W. T Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 632-633
(1953).
These factual determinations established, the ALJ ad-
dressed the two-part test that must be satisfied for state-
action immunity under the antitrust laws, the test we set out
in CaliforniaR etail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Alumi-
num, Inc., 445 U. S. 97 (1980). A state law or regulatory
scheme cannot be the basis for antitrust immunity unless,
first, the State has articulated a clear and affirmative policy
to allow the anticompetitive conduct, and second, the State
provides active supervision of anticompetitive conduct un-
dertaken by private actors. Id., at 105. The Commission
having conceded that the first part of the test was satisfied
in the four States still at issue, the immunity question, begin-
ning with the hearings before the ALJ and in all later pro-
ceedings, has turned upon the proper interpretation and
application of Midcal's active supervision requirement. The
ALJ found the active supervision test was met in Arizona
and Montana but not in Connecticut or Wisconsin. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 248a.
On review of the ALJ's decision, the Commission held that
none of the four States had conducted sufficient supervision,
so that the title companies were not entitled to immunity in
any of those jurisdictions. Id., at 47a. The Court of Ap-
peals for the Third Circuit disagreed with the Commission,
adopting the approach of the First Circuit in New England
Motor Rate Bureau, Inc. v. FTC, 908 F. 2d 1064 (1990), which

Opinion of the Court
had held that the existence of a state regulatory program, if
staffed, funded, and empowered by law, satisfied the require-
ment of active supervision. Id., at 1071. Under this stand-
ard, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that
the active state supervision requirement was met in all four
States and held that the respondents' conduct was entitled
to state-action immunity in each of them. 922 F. 2d, at 1140.
We granted certiorari to consider two questions: First,
whether the Third Circuit was correct in its statement of the
law and in its application of law to fact, and second, whether
the Third Circuit exceeded its authority by departing from
the factual findings entered by the ALJ and adopted by the
Commission. Before this Court, the parties have confined
their briefing on the first of these questions to the regulatory
regimes of Wisconsin and Montana, and focused on the regu-
latory regimes of Connecticut and Arizona in briefing on the
second question. We now reverse the Court of Appeals
under the first question and remand for further proceedings
under the second.

The preservation of the free market and of a system of
free enterprise without price fixing or cartels is essential to
economic freedom. United States v. Topco Associates, Inc.,
405 U. S. 596, 610 (1972). A national policy of such a perva-
sive and fundamental character is an essential part of the
economic and legal system within which the separate States
administer their own laws for the protection and advance-
ment of their people. Continued enforcement of the national
antitrust policy grants the States more freedom, not less, in
deciding whether to subject discrete parts of the economy
to additional regulations and controls. Against this back-
ground, in Parkerv . Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943), we upheld
a state-supervised, market sharing scheme against a Sher-
man Act challenge. We announced the doctrine that federal
antitrust laws are subject to supersession by state regula-
