OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion Harlan, J.
The clear tendency of such an agreement is to es-
tablish a monopoly, and to destroy competition in trade,
and for that reason, on grounds of public policy, the courts
will not aid in its enforcement. It is no answer to say that
'competition in the salt trade was not in fact destroyed, or that
the price of the commodity was not unreasonably advanced.
Courts will not stop to inquire as to the degree of injury in-
flicted upon the public, it is enough to know that the. inev-
itable tendency of such contracts is injurious to the public."
In Craft v _McConoughy, 79 Illinois, 346, 349, 350, which
related to a combination between all the grain dealers of a
particular town to stifle competition, and to obtain control of
the price of grain, the Supreme Court of Illinois said "While
the argument, upon its face, would seem to indicate that the
parties had formed a copartnership for the purpose of trading
in grain, yet, from the terms of the contract, and the other
proof in the record, it is apparent that the true object was, to
form a secret combination which would stifle all competition,
and enable the parties, by secret and fraudulent means, to con-
trol the price of grain, cost of storage, and expense of ship-
ment. In other words, the four firms, by a shrewd, deep-laid,
secret combination, attempted to control and monopolize the
entire grain trade of the town and surrounding country That
the effect of this contract was to restrain the trade and com-
merce of the country, is a proposition that cannot be success-
fully denied. We understand it to be a well-settled rule of
law, that an agreement in general restraint of trade is contrary
to public policy, illegal and void, but an agreement in par-
tial or particular restraint upon trade has been held good,
where the restraint was only partial, consideration adequate,
and the restriction reasonable." "While these parties were in
business, in competition with each other, they had the un-
doubted right to establish their own rates for grain stored and
commissions for shipment and sale. They could pay as high
or low a price for grain as they saw proper, and as they could
make contracts with the producer. So long as competition
was free, the interest of the public was safe. The laws of
trade, in connection with the right of competition, were all the

guaranty the public required, but the secret combination created
by the contract destroyed all competition and created a mo-
nopoly against which the public interest had no protection."
These principles were applied in People v. Chwago Gas
Trust Co., 130 Illinois, 269, 292, 297, which involved the valid-
ity of a corporation formed for the purpose of operating gas
works, and of manufacturing and selling gas, and which, for
the purpose of destroying competition, acquired the stock of
four other gas companies, and thereby obtained a monopoly
in the business of fuirmshing illuminating gas to the city of'
Chicago-and its inhabitants. The court, in declaring the or-
ganization of the company to be illegal, said "The fact that.
the appellee, almost immediately after its organization, bought
up a majority of the shares of stock of each of these compa-
nies, shows that it was not making a mere investment of sur-
plus funds, but that it designed and intended to bring the four
companies under its control, and by crushing out competition
to monopolize the gas business in Chicago." "Of what avail,"
said the court, "is it that any number of gas companies may
be formed under the general incorporation law, if a giant trust.
company can be clothed with the power of buying up and
holding the stock and property of such companies, and, through
the control thereby attained, can direct all their operations andI
weld them into one huge combination 2"
So, in India Bagging Associaton, v Zock, 14: La. Ann..
168, where the court passed upon the legality of an associa-
tion of various commercial firms in New Orleans that were.
engaged in the sale of India bagging, it was said "The
agreement between the parties was palpably and unequivo
cably a combination in restraint of trade, and to enhance the
price in the market of an article of primary necessity to cot-
ton planters. Such combinations are contrary to public order,.
and cannot be enforced in a court of justice."
In Santa Clara lill & Lumber Co. v HEayes, 76 California,.
387, 390, which related to a combination, the result of certain
contracts among certain manufacturers, the court found that.
the object, purpose, and consideration of those contracts was
to form a combination among all the manufacturers of lumbe

at or near a particular place, for the sole purpose of increas-
ing the price of that article, limiting the amount to be manu-
factured, and giving certain parties the control of all lumber
manufactured near that place for the year 1881, and of the
supply for that year in specified counties. It held the combi-
nation to be illegal, observing that "among the contracts
illegal under the common law, because opposed to public
policy, were contracts in general restraint of trade, contracts
between individuals to prevent competition and keep up the
price of articles of utility" It further said that while the
courts had nothing to do with the results naturally flowing
from the laws of demand and supply, they would not respect
agreements made for the purpose of "taking trade out of the
realm of competition, and thereby enhancing or depressing
prices of commodities."
A leading case on the question as to what combinations are
illegal as being in general restraint of trade, is Richardson v
Buhl, 77 Michigan, 632, 635, 657, 660, which related to certain
agreements connected with the business and operations of the
Diamond Match Company From the report of the case it
appears that that company was organized, under the laws
of Connecticut, for the purpose of uniting in one corporation
all the match manufactories in the United States, and to
monopolize and control the business of making all the friction
matches in the country, and establish the price thereof. To
that end it became necessary, among other things, to buy many
plants that had become established or were about to be estab-
lisiied, as well as the property used in connection therewith.
Chief Justice Sherwood of the Supreme Court of Michigan
said "The sole object of the corporation is to make money
by having it in its power to raise the price of the article, or
diminish the quantity to be made and used, at its pleasure.
Thus both the supply of the article and the price thereof are
made to depend upon the action of a half dozen individuals,
more or less, to satisfy their cupidity and avarice, who may
happen to have the controlling interest in this corporation -
an artificial person, governed by a single motive or purpose,
which is to accumulate money regardless of the wants or neces-
