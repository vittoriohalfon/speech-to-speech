NORTHERN SECURITIES CO. v. UNITED STATES. 365
193 U. S. WHITE, J., The CampF JUSTICE, PECKHAm, HOLmEs, JJ., dissenting.
Under these circumstances Mr. Morgan and Mr. Hill organized
under the laws of New Jersey the Northern Securities Com-
pany. The purpose was that the company should become the
holder of the stock of the two railroads. This was to be ef-
fected by having the Northern Securities Company give its
stock in exchange for that of the two railroad companies.
Whilst the purpose of the promoters was mainly to exchange
the stock held by them in the two railroads for the Northern
Securities Company stock, nevertheless the right of stock-
holders generally in the two railroads to make a similar ex-
change or to sell their stock to the Securities Company was
provided for. Under the arrangement the Northern Securi-
ties Company came to be the registered holder of a majority
of the stock of both the railroads. It is not denied that the
charter, and the acts done under it, of the Northern Securities
Company, were authorized by the laws of New Jersey, and,
therefore, in so far as those laws were competent to sanction
the transaction, the corporation held the stock in the two rail-
roads secured by the law of the State of its domicil.
The government by its bill challenges the right of the North-
ern Securities Company to hold and own the stock in the two
railroads. The grounds upon which the relief sought was
based were, generally speaking, as follows: That as the two
railroads were competing lines engaged in part in interstate
commerce, the creation of the Northern Securities Company
and the acquisition by it of a majority of the stock of both
roads was contrary to the act of Congress known as the Anti-
Trust Act. 26 Stat. 209. The clauses of the act which it
was charged were violated were the first section, declaring
illegal "every contract, combination in the form of trust or
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce
among the several States, or with foreign nations;" and the
provisions of the second section making it a misdemeanor for
any person to "monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or com-
bine or conspire with any other persoi or persons, to monopo-
lize any part of the trade or commerce among the several

States or with foreign nations." The court below sustained
the contentions of the government. It, therefore, enjoined
the two railroad companies from allowing the Northern So-
curities Company to vote the stock standing in its name or to
pay to that company any dividends upon the stock by it held.
On the giving, however, of a bond fixed by the court below
the decree relating to the payment of dividends was sus-
pended pending the appeal to this court.
The court recognized, however, the right of the Northern
Securities Company to retransfer the stock in both railroads
to the persons from whom it had been acquired. The correct-
ness of the decree below is the question presented for decision.
Two questions arise. Does the Anti-Trust Act, when rightly
interpreted, apply to the acquisition and ownership by the
Northern Securities Company of the stock in the two railroads,
and, second, if it does, had Congress the power to regulate or
control such acquisition and ownership? As the question of
power lies at the root of the case, I come at once to consider
that subject. Before doing so, however, in order to avoid
being misled by false or irrelevant issues, it is essential to
briefly consider two questions of fact. It is said, first, that
the mere exchange by the Northern Securities Company of
its stock for stock in the railroads did not make the Northern
Securities Company the real owner of the stock in the rail-
roads, since the effect of the transaction was to cause the Se-
curities Company to become merely the custodian or trustee
of the stock in the railroads; second, that as the two railro'ld ,
were both over-capitalized, stock in them furnished no suf-
ficient consideration for the issue of the stock of the Northern
Securities Company. It would suffice to point out, a, that
the proof shows that nearly nine million dollars were paid by
the Securities Company for a portion of the stock acquired
by it, and that, moreover, nearly thirty-five million dollars were
expended by the Securities Company in the purchase of bonds
of the Northern Pacific Company, which have been converted
by the Securities Company into the stock of that railroad,

which the Securities Company now holds; and, b, that the
market value of the railroad stocks is, moreover, indisputably
shown by the proof to have been equal to the value fixed on
them for the purpose of the exchange or purchase of such
stock by the Northern Securities Company. Be this as it
may, it is manifest that these considerations can have no
possible influence on the question of the power of Congress in
the premises; and therefore the suggestions can serve only to
obscure the controversy. If the power was in Congress to
legislate on the subject it becomes wholly immaterial what
was the nature of the consideration paid by the company for
the stock by it acquired and held if such acquisition and owner-
ship, even if real, violated the act of Congress. If on the con-
trary the authority of Congress could not embrace the right
of the Northern Securities Company to acquire and own the
stock, the question of what consideration the Northern Se-
curities Company paid for the stock or the method by which
it was transferred must necessarily be beyond the scope of the
act of Congress.
In testing the power of Congress I shall proceed upon the
assumption that the act of Congress forbids the acquisition of
a majority of the stock of two competing railroads engaged in
part in interstate commerce by a corporation or any combina-
tion of persons.
The authority of Congress, it is conceded by all, must rest
upon the power delegated by the eighth section of the first
article of the Constitution, "to regulate Commerce with for-
eign Nations, and among the several States and with the
Indian tribes." The proposition upon which the case for
the government depends then is that the ownership of stock
in railroad corporations created by a State is interstate
commerce, wherever the railroads engage in interstate com-
merce.
At the outset, the absolute correctness is admitted of the
declaration of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden,
that the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the
