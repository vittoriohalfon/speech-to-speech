ever, 'that a restraint upon competition may be a restraint
upon trade; but it is asserted that whether it is so or not,
in any particular case, depends upon the nature and effect
of the restraint imposed in such case.
(2) The argument thus reaches one of the main subjects
of discussion, namely, what the effects of competition in trade
are; when they are good; and when, if ever, they are bad;
and how such restraints have been regarded in public economy,
law and legislation. This subject is treated at frst generally,
without reference to the'particular effects of competition in
the business of railroad transportation.
(3) It is then pointed out that the particular field of dis-
cussion in the case has been, by what precedes, fully disclosed,
namely, the efects-of restraints upon competition as restrain-
ing, or not restraining, trade and commerce, and a particular
proposition, substantially equivalent to the main one, is stated
as follows:
"The agreement in question, as a whole, and, particularly,
so much of it as affects competition, is in the highest degree
promotive of trade and commerce." The discussion on this
head pursues the following course :
(a) It begins with a statement of "the origin, development
and present condition in this country of the business of rail-
way transportation," and shows that by the deliberate.policy
of all our governments, state and INational, business has
been, from the first, subjected to the severest involuntary
competition, and it points out the ruinous results to which
such competition leads when it -takes place on rates, aid aims
to show that such results can be arrested, or mitigated, only
by allowing the competing parties to displace the strife by
some form of agreement. (b)T his discussion is proceeded
with by pointing out what the main requisites of a good rail-
way service are, and how they are affected by railway compe-
tition in rates. It aims to show that such competition, by
making uniformity in rates impossible, makes it impossible
to secure any of these essential requisites, and that they can
be secured only by some form of concerted agreement between
the parties.

-UNITED STATES v. JOINT TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION. 521
Mr. Carter's Argument for The Joint Traffic Association.
(4) The subject of agreements between railway companies
:and co~perative traffic associations being thus reached, a sketch
is made of their origin and development down to the time of
the passage of the Interstate Commerce law, and it is shown
that the most efficacious form of agreement down to that
time had been found to be that of pooling.
(5) The Interstate Commerce law and its effects are then
discussed, and it is shown that one of its main objects was to
bring about, so fa; as Federal legislation could accomplish it,
uniformity in rates, and thus put an end to the practice of dis-
crimination, and attention is called to the incidental feature
of the law which prohibited pooling agreements. It is then
shown that the effect of that law was to increase and aggra-
vate the very evils which it was designed to remove. Pooling
being prohibited, the most effective method for securing uni-
formity in rates could no longer be employed, and ruinous
competition, with every form of discrimination, followed, and
to these evils was added the unendurable aggravation that the
practices which the law could not prevent were, nevertheless,
converted into crimes.
(6) It is then shown that the necessity was universally felt
for some form of concerted action which would put an end to
these deplorable conditions and that the present agreement
was the result of an earnest effort in this direction.
(7) An analysis-of the agreement is then made, and it is
pointed out that it is not aimed against competition in general,
but assumes that such competition will still continue actively
and earnestly on every point except that of rates.
Its precise effect upon competition in rates is dealt with, and it
is shown that while its object is to secure uniformity in rates
by inducing competing companies to consent to such uniform-
ity, it does not purport to require it or compel it. -That it does
not really, or in any proper sense, seek to restrain competition
at all, but aims to render competition open, honest and lawful,
so that the business of railway transportation may be con-
ducted in conformity with the requirements of the Interstate
Commerce law, and without the daily commission of crime.
It shows that, to this end,,it is necessary that each railroad

company should first establish its rates and should adhere to
them for a reasonable period, which is fixed at thirty days, in
order if -it intends a change that it may give reasonable
notice of its intention in time to enable the competing parties
to meet it, and to shape their own conduct accordingly; that
this is absolutely the only restraint upon competition effected
by the agreement, and being only slight and temporary, and
necessary in order to enable. competition to be open and law-
ful, cannot be regarded as a restraint upon trade. It admits
that one of its main objects is to secure what the Interstate
Commerce law sought to secure, uniformity in rates, but its
method of effecting that result is, not by a compulsory agree-
ment, but by taking away the motives to ruinous, secret and
unlawful competition in rates. It also points out the many
other beneficial provisions of the agreement by which it is
sought to make the railroad- transportation of the country
regular, orderly, safe and effective.
(8) It further seeks to emphasize the beneficial purposes of
the agreement by showing that every great industry in which
the co5peration of many different proprietors and agencies is
required, -necessarily calls for a system of regulation which
must be supplied either by the action of goverzment, or, in
the absence of such action, by the voluntary action of those
who are engaged in it, and it pronounces the association as
"an institution for the regulation of transportation business
in those respects in which the State, either from lack of juris-
diction, or because it deems that the regulation could be best
devised and administered by the railroad systems themselves,
has chosen not to regulate it."
(9) Thioughout this part of the argument the central propo-
sition is that of the absolute necessity for some agency by
which uniformity in rates may be brought about, and a uni-
formity not only in the case of merchandise shipped from the
same point to the same terminus, but also in the case of mer-
chandise shipped from, or to, any points in any way competing.
So long as competition in rates exists different men and dif-
ferent places will necessarily be put up, or pulled down, en-
riched or ruined, as one railroad company may think it to be
