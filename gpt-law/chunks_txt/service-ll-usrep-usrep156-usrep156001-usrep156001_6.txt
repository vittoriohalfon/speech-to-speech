OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.
often cited, the state laws, which were held inoperative, were
instances of direct interference with, or regulations of, inter-
state or international commerce, yet in Kidd v Pearson the
refusal of a State to allow articles to be manufactured within
her borders even for export was held not to directly affect
external commerce, and state legislation which, in a great
variety of ways, affected interstate commerce and persons
engaged in it, has been frequently sustained because the
interference was not direct.
Contracts, combinations, or conspiracies to control domestic
enterprise in manufacture, agriculture, mining, production in
all its forms, or to raise or lower prices or wages, might un-
questionably tend to restrain external as well as domestic
trade, but the restraint would be an indirect result, however
inevitable and whatever its extent, and such result would not
necessarily determine the object of the contract, combination,
or conspiracy
Again, all the authorities agree that in order to vitiate a
contract or combination it is not essential that its result
should be a complete monopoly, it is sufficient if it really
tends to that end and to deprive the public of the advantages
which flow from free competition. Slight reflection will
show that if the national power extends to all contracts and
combinations in manufacture, agriculture, mining, and other
productive industries, whose ultimate result may affect ex-
ternal commerce, comparatively little of business operations
and affairs would be left for state control.
It was in the light of well-settled principles that the act of
July 2, 1890, was framed. Congress did not attempt thereby
to assert the power to deal with monopoly directly as such, or
to limit and restrict the rights of corporations created by the
States or the citizens of the States in the acquisition, control,
or disposition of property, or to regulate or prescribe the
price or prices at which such property or the products thereof
should be sold, or to make criminal the acts of persons in the
acquisition and control of property which the States of their
residence or creation sanctioned or permitted. Aside from
the provisions applicable where Congress might exercise mu-

nicipal power, what the law struck at was combinations, con-
tracts, and conspiracies to monopolize trade and commerce
among the several States or with foreign nations, but the
contracts and acts of the defendants related exclusively to
the acquisition of the Philadelphia refineries and the business
of sugar refining in Pennsylvania, and bore no direct relation
to commerce between the States or with foreign nations.
The object was manifestly private gain in the manufacture
of the commodity, but not through the control of interstate
or foreign commerce. It is true that the bill alleged that
the products of these refineries were sold and distributed
among the several States, and that all the compames were
engaged in trade or commerce with the several States and
with foreign nations, but this was no more than to say that
trade and commerce served manufacture to fulfil its function.
Sugar was refined for sale, and sales were probably made at
Philadelphia for consumption, and undoubtedly for resale
by the first purchasers throughout Pennsylvania and other
States, and refined sugar was also forwarded by the com-
panies to other States for sale. Nevertheless it does not
follow that an attempt to monopolize, or the actual monopoly
of, the manufacture was an attempt, whether executory or
consummated, to monopolize commerce, even though, in order
to dispose of the product, the instrumentality of commerce
was necessarily invoked. There was nothing in the proofs
to indicate any intention to put a restraint upon trade or
commerce, and the fact, as we have seen, that trade or com-
merce might be indirectly affected was not enough to entitle
complainants to a decree. The subject-matter of the sale
was shares of manufacturing stock, and the relief sought was
the surrender of property which had already passed and the
suppression. of the alleged monopoly in manufacture by the
restoration of the 8tatus quo before the transfers,yet the act
of Congress only authorized the Circuit Courts to proceed by
way of preventing and restraining violations of the act in
respect of contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint
of interstate or international trade or commerce.
The Circuit Court declined, upon the pleadings and prodfs,

Decree ofirmed.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.
Prior to the 4th day of March, 1892, the American Sugar
Refining Company, a corporation organized under a general
statute of :New Jersey for the purpose of buying, manufact-
uring, refining, and selling sugar sn different parts of the coun-
try, had obtained the control of all the sugar refineries in the
United States except five, of which four were owned and op-
erated by Pennsylvania corporations - the E. C. Knight Com-
pany, the Franklin Sugar Refining Company, Spreckels' Sugar
Refining Company, and the Delaware Sugar House -and the
other, by the Revere Sugar Refinery of Boston. These five
corporations were all in active competition with the American
Sugar Refining Company and with each other. The product
of the Pennsylvania companies was about thirty-three per
cent, and that of the Boston company about two per cent, of
the entire quantity of sugar refined in the United States.
In March, 1892, by means of contracts or arrangements
with stockholders of the four Pennsylvania companies, the
New Jersey corporation -using for that purpose its own
stock -purchased the stock of those companies, and thus ob-
tained absolute control of the entire business of sugar refining
in the United States except that done by the Boston company
which is too small in amount to be regarded in this discussion.
"The object," the court below said, "in -purchasing the
Philadelphia refineries was to obtain a greater influence or
more perfaect control over the busyness of refining ,and selling
sugar sn this country." This characterization of the object
for which this stupendous combination was formed is properly
accepted in the opinion of the court as justified by the
proof. I need not therefore analyze the evidence upon this
point. In its consideration of the important constitutional
question presented, this court assumes on the record before us
