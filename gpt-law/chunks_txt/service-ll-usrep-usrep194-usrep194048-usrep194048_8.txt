salability thereof, depends, in very large measure, upon having
free, uninterrupted and open competition in passenger and
freight rates over the lines of railway owned and operated by
said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies."
The bill also alleges "that many of said lands are vacant and
unsettled and located in regions not at present reached by
railway lines, and depend for settlement upon the construction
of line- in the future; that it has heretofore been the practice
of said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway com-
panies, respectively, to extend spur, lines into territory adja-
cent to each of said roads, as well as into new territory, for the
purpose of developing such territory, as well as to obtain traffic
therefrom; that such new lines have been built in the past very
largely by reason of the rivalry heretofore existing between
said companies for existing, as well as new, business; that under
the consolidation and unity of control hereinafter set forth
such rivalry will cease, and many of the lands now owned by
the State of Minnesota will not be reached by railroads for
years to come, if at all, owing to such combination and con-
solidation removing all rivalry and competition between said
companies; that the settlement and occupation of said lands
will add very much to their value, and such occupation will
depend entirely upon the accessibility of railway lines and
transportation facilities for marketing the products raised
thereon; that if said lands are sold and become occupied, they
will add very largely to the taxable value of the property of the
State, and that said lands cannot be so sold, or the income of
the State increased thereby, without the construction of rail-
road lines to or adjacent to the same."
It was further alleged that the State is the owner of, and has
maintained at large expense, a state university, hospitals foi
the insane, normal sehools for teachers, a training school for
boys and girls, schools for deaf, dumb, blind and feeble-minded
persons, a state school for indigent and homeless children, and
a state penitentiary; that a great portion of the supplies of
every kind for such institutions must, of necessity, be :,ipped

over the different lines of railway owned and operated by the
Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railway companies;
that the amount of taxes which the state must collect, and the
successful maintenance of its public institutions, as well as the
performance of its governmental functions and affairs, depend
largely upon the value 'of the real and personal property situ-
ated within the State and the general prosperity and business
success of its citizens; and that such prosperity -and business
depend very largely upon maintaining in the State. free, open
and unrestricted competition between the railway lines of
tlose two companies.
The injury on account of which the present'suit was brought
is at most only remote and indirect; such an injury as would
come alike, -although in different degrees, to every individual
owner of property in a State by reason of the suppression, in
violation of the act of Congress, of free competition between
ifiterstate carriers engaged, in business in such State" not such
a direct, actual injury as that provided for in the seventh sec-
tion of the statute. If Minnesota may, by an original suit,
in its name, invoke the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, be-
cause 'alone of the alleged remote and 'indirect injury to its
proprietary interests arising from the mere absence of free
competition in trade and commerce as carried on by interstate
carriers within its limits, then every State upon like grounds
may maintain, in its name, in a Circuit Court' of the United
States, a suit against interstate carriers engaged in business
within their respective limits. Further, under that view, every
individual owner of property in a State may, upon like general
grounds, by an original suit, irrespective of any direct or special
injury to him, invoke the original jurisdiction of a Circuit
Court of the United States, to restrain and prevent violations
of the Anti-Trust Act of Congress. We do not think that
Congress contemplated any such 'methods for the enforcement
of th6 Anti'-Trust Act. We cannot suppose it was intended
that the enforcement of the act should depend in any degree
,upon original suits in equity instituted by the States or by

individuals to prevent violations of its provisions. On the
contrary, taking all the sections of that act together, we think
that its intention was to limit direct proceedings in 'equity to
prevent and restrain such violations of the Anti-Trust, Act
as cause. injury to the general public, or to all. alike, merely
from the suppression of competition in trade and commerce
among the several States and with foreign nations, to those
instituted in the name of the United States, under the fourth
section of the act, by District Attorneys of the United 8'tatc,3,
acting under the direction of the Attorney General; thus
securing the enforcement of the act, so far as direct proceed-
ings in equity are concerned, according to some uniform pla,
operative throughout the entire country. Possibly the t.hought
of Congress was that by such a limitation upon suits in equity
of a general nature to restrain violations of the act, irrespective
of any direct-injury sustained by particular persons or orpo-
rations, interstate and international trade and commerce and
those carrying on such trade and commerce, as well as the
general business of the country, would not be needlessly dis-.
turbed by suits brought, on all sides and in every direetio-n, in
accomplish improper or speculative purposes. At any rate,
the interpretation we have given of the act is a more reasonable
one. It is a safe and conservative interpretstion, in view as
well of the broad and exclusive power of Congress over inter-
state and international commerce as of the fact that, so far as
such commerce is concerned, Congress has prescribed a speeific
mode for.preventing restraints upon it, namely, suits in equity
under the direction of the Attorney General. Of the pres eat
suit the Attorney General has no control, and is without any
responsibility for the manner in which it is conducted, although,
in its essential features, it is just such a suit as would be brought
by -his direction when proceeding under the fourth section o[
the Anti-Trust Act.
The State presents still another view of the question of juris-
diction. Its complaint alleges that if the Securities Cornpany
be allowed to hold and control the stocks of the Great Northern
