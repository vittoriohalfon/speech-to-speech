Brief of Mr. Grover for Great Northern Railway. 193 U. S.
The only way in which the Securities Company could rest rain
the commerce of the two railway companies, is through the
voting power of the shares it owns. If it had purchased the
shares of only one of the companies, its right to vote such
shares would not be questioned. Trade could not, within the
contention of the Government, or the ruling of the court, be
restrained by the Securities Company, should its voting powers
be limited to the shares of one of the companies. The decree
enjoins it from voting the shares of either company and from
receiving dividends from either. The effect of the decree is
to deprive it of the means to pay dividends upon its own stock
whether issued in payment for the stock it purchase(], or issued
for cash. Thus the decree destroys the earning power of the
stock of the Securities Company, a large majority of which is
now held by over eighteen hundred bona fide holders in the
usual course of business not parties to the suit.
The important questions are: 1. Does the commerce clause
of the Constitution of the United States confer upon Congress
jurisdiction to regulate the issue, sale and ownership of the
capital stock of corporations organized under the laws of any
one of the several States, or to inquire into the motives of in-
corporators, or of the buyers or sellers of their shares?
2. Has Congress, under the commerce clause of the Con-
stitution of the United States, power to forbid or regulate the
purchase or lease, by one railway company engaged in inter-
state commerce, of the railway of its competitor, or the pur-
chase or lease by the owner of one ferryboat, stage coach or
river steamboat, engaged in interstate trade, of the ferryboat,
stage coach or river steamboat, of a competitor, on the ground
that through such purchase or lease competition may be re-
strained, and commerce regulated?
3. Is the unity of ownership through purchase, partnership,
consolidation or lease, of a majority of the shares of compet-
ing corporations, engaged in interstate trade, a contract or
combination in the form of trust or otherwise, forbidden by
the Anti-Trust Act, as in restraint of trade?

4. Is there anything in connection with the organization of
the Northern Securities Company, or its purchasers of stock,
that in any way distinguishes its right to vote and receive divi-
dends upon such stock from the right of any single interest,
individual or corporate, to vote and receive dividends upon
shares of competing corporations engaged in interstate trade,
purchased in the ordinary course of business, or acquired by
gift or inheritance?
5. This suit was brought under section 4 of the Anti-Trust
Act, which gives the court jurisdiction to prevent and restrain
violations of the act. Every violation of the act is criminal.
The court is, therefore, given jurisdiction to prevent and re-
strain the commission of a crime. Months before the suit was
begun, the Securities Company had acquired a large majority
of the shares of the defendant railway companies, from time
to time, from hundreds of individual shareholders, who sold
their holdings in good faith, and much of the stock so taken
in payment therefor has since been sold and exchanged, and
passed through many hands, in the usual course of business.
Does the Anti-Trust Act give the court jurisdiction to annul
the purchases made by the Northern Securities Company, and
compel a return of the shares it purchased? Payment for the
shares it bought was made in its own stock in part only. It
paid cash to the amount of over $40,000,000. The owners of
such shares are changing from day to day; they are-not be-
fore the court. The decree does not restrain a contract or
combination in restraint of trade. It destroys or impairs the
value of millions of dollars worth of property, owned by many
hundreds of people who acquired their title in good faith and
who are not parties to this suit. First. The commerce clause
of the Constitution of the United States does not take away
from the several States the right to authorize the formation
of corporations, define their business, fix the amount of their
capital or purchasing power, and regulate the issue, sale and
ownership of their capital stock.
As respects the purchase by one corporation of the shares

of another, the matter rests with the States which have created
the corporations. Should unification of ownership of property
in corporations proceed to such an extent as to be thought
against public policy, it may be prevented by the several States,
through limiting the power of corporations, and restraining
their right to engage in business.
It has been the practice, since the infancy of railroads in this
country, for one railroad company to purchase or lease the
railroad of a competing company, or to acquire a majority of
the shares of a competing company, or of two companies com-
peting with each other, or to effect the consolidation of com-
peting companies. This has been done without objection from
any branch of the Federal Government, and has invariably
proven beneficial to the railway companies concerned, to their
shareholders, and to the public. The extent to which this has
been done appears in the record, and is shown by extracts
from Poor's Manual and from the annual reports made by
the Interstate Commerce Commission to Congress, from 1889
to 1900. And see the brief of Judge Young where this
subject is discussed at length with proper reference to the
record.
Second. Unity of ownership of shares of competing corpora-
tions, engaged in interstate trade, does not restrain such trade,
and is not forbidden by the Anti-Trust Act, nor is such unity
of ownership a regulation of interstate commerce, and thus
subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction under the commerce
clause of the Constitution. Joint Traffic, Trajs-Missouria nd

There is a distinct difference between an agreement between
the owners of competing concerns, to divide territory, to re-
strain output, or to maintain prices, and the unconditional sale
of the property or business of one of them to the other, or of
the property of business of both to another person. In the
former case, the agreement in terms restrains competition in
trade operations, between separate owners or establishments,
or instrumentalities engaged in such operations. The agree-
