of Appeals, 172 N. Y 176. But the court will not discharge
a defendant arrested under the governor's warrant where
there is merely contradictory evidence on the subject of
presence in or absence from the State, as habeas corpus is not
the proper proceeding to try the question of alibi, or any
question as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. As a
prima facze case existed for the retirn of the plaintiff in error,
and she refused to give any evidence upon the return of the
writ which she had herself sued out, other than the papers
before the governor, no case was made out for her discharge,
and the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire
refusing to grant it must, therefore, be
Affirmed.
SWIFT AND COMPANY v UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COUIRT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 103. Argued January 6, 7, 1905.-Decided January 30, 1905.
A combination of a dominant proportion of the dealers in fresh meat through-
out the United States, not to bid against, or only in conjunction with,
each other in order to regulate prices in and induce shipments to the
live stock markets in other States, to restrict shipments, establish uniform
rules of credit, make uniform and improper rules of cartage, and to get
less than lawful rates from railroads to the exclusion of competitors with
intent to monopolize commerce among the States, is an illegal combina-
tion within the meaning and prohibition of the act of July 2, 1890, 26
Stat. 209, and can be restrained and enjoined in an action by the United
States.
It does not matter that a combination of this naturi embraces restraint
and monopoly of trade within a single State if it also embraces and is di-
rected against commerce among the States. Moreover the effect of such
a combination upon interstate commerce is direct and not accidental,
secondary or remote as in United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1.
Even if the separate elements of such a scheme are lawful, when thy"
are bound together by a common intent as parts of an unlawful scheme to
monopolize interstate commerce the plan may make the parts unla-wful.

they will end their transit, after purchase, in another State, and when in er-
fect they do so, with only the interruption necessary to find a purchaser
at the stock yards, and when this is a constantly recurring course, it con-
stitutes interstate commerce and the purchase of the cattle is an incident
of such commerce.
A bill in equity, and the demurrer thereto, are neither of them to be rad
and construed strictly as an indictment but are to be taken to nican
what they fairly convey to a dispassionate reader by a fairly exact use
of English speech.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr John S. Miller, with whom Mr MerrittS tarr was on the
brief, for appellants:
The charges in each of the paragraphs or counts of the bill
or petition of alleged violations of the Sherman Act are, re-
spectively, mere statements of legal conclusions. Each is bad
on demurrer for that reason.
These charges would be bad on that ground, even in an
indictment under this act. In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104,
United States v Cruikshank, 92 U S. 542, 563, United States v
Simmons, 96 U S. 360; United States v Carll, 105 U S. 611,
United States v Britton, 107 U S. 655, Hazard v Griswold, 21
Fed. Rep. 178. And a fortiori are they bad in a bill or petition
in equity, which is required to state the facts essential to the
cause of action. Lawson v Hewell, 118 California, 613, Wrkght
v Dame, 22 Pick. 59, Ambler v Choteau, 107 U S. 586, Van
Weel v Winston, 115 U S. 228, 237, 1 Foster Fed. Prac. ยง6 7
The facts alleged are looked at and not adjectives or adverbs
or epithets. Magmac v Thompson, 2 Wall. Jr. 209; Price v
Coleman, 21 Fed. Rep. 357, Van Weel v Winston, and Ambler
v Choteau, supra.
The importance of applying this rule with strictness here is
more marked because answer by the defendants under oath is
called for. This point is properly raised by demurrer. 1

The decree complained of, which is merely one of injunction,
is erroneous on like grounds of indefiniteness. Laurie v.

It makes clear the msconception of the Sherman Act and
of Federal power to regulate commerce upon which the bill
and decree proceed. They appear to go upon the theory that
under the act of Congress the Federal courts are to regulate
commerce, and the decree enjoins, not specific acts, but viola-
tions of the statute in terms as general as the act of Congress
itself. A defendant cannot know from its terms what he may
or may not do without making himself liable as in contempt.
This makes the insufficiency of the bill more obvious, as no
valid decree could have been entered upon its allegations.
The provisions of the Sherman Act do not contemplate such
a general proceeding or decree to interfere in advance with
future dealings, as interstate commerce, which may be inter-
state trade or may be domestic trade according to the future
and changeable intention of the dealers. United States v.
E. C Knsght Co., 156 U S. 1, 15.
The business of defendants of purchasing live stock and of
selling fresh meats produced therefrom, as described in the bill,
is not, upon the allegations of fact in the bill, interstate or
foreign commerce.
The purchase of cattle is alleged and described in the first
paragraph of the bill is not alleged or shown to be interstate
commerce.
The business of defendants of selling such fresh meats, at the
several places where they are so prepared, as described in the
second paragraph, is not, under the facts there alleged, inter-
state trade o commerce. The sales and deliveries, although
to dealers in other States and Territories, are there alleged to
be made at the %laces where the meats are prepared by defend-
ants, and are domestic sales.
The deliveries by defendants to the carriers, who are agents
of the purchasers iii that respect, under the allegations of the
bill, are deliveries to the purchasers in the State where the sale
is made; and the sales and deliveries are there fully completed.
