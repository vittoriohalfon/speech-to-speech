ownership of Burlington shares, and by reason of the obliga-
tion assumed in paying for the shares, they have a common
interest in building up the traffic of each in connection with
the Burlington Company. This connection became necessary
to their prosperity, to the welfare of their patrons, and to the
successful meeting of a world-wide competition. What has
been done was done, not to restrain competition, but to en-
large it.
The unity of ownership of their shares has not restrained
the. commerce of either, and the extent to which such unity
can restrain it, is as nothing compared with the great increase
in volume of interstate and international commerce which was
intended, and which will result from the carrying out of the
enterprise of the two companies in the purchase of the Bur-
lington stock, and the preservation of the purchase, and its
benefits, by placing the stock of the railroad companies where
it is less likely to become scattered and to pass under control
of adverse interests, than it would be if held by many owners.
Mr. Francis Lynde Stetson and Mr. David Willcox for ap-
pellants, Morgan, Bacon and Lamont, submitted a brief:
The transactions alleged are entirely lawful in their char-
acter. They consisted merely in the organization of a lawful
corporation of New Jersey, and in the sale to, and purchase by,
it of property lawfully salable. All the acts were expressly
authorized by law. The legal effect of the transaction has
been that the owner of stock in one of the railway companies
has sold the same to the Securities Company, and has re-
ceived therefor stock of the Securities Company, which com-
pany owns the stock not merely of one of the railway com-
panies, but the stock of both. So that each individual who
has transferred his property to the Securities Company has
obtained therefor something entirely different-namely, an
interest in a company holding stock of the other railway com-
pany as well. It is manifest that in the fullest possible sense
this constituted a sale of the property. Berger v. U. S. Sleel

Corp., 53 Atl. Rep. (N. J.) 68. The title passed for valuable
consideration to a purchaser authorized to hold the property.
Aside from the corporate form of the transaction, the effect,
too, was that each stockholder in one of the railway com-
panies transferred an interest in his holdings to every other
such stockholder.
These transactions being lawful are not affected by allega-
tions as to the motive which actuated them. As the means
employed were lawful, the only question must be whether the
result accomplished was unlawful. Pettibone v. United States,

An intent to violate the Anti-Trust Act, and therefore to
commit a crime, could not in any case be inferred, but must
be actually proved.
No indirect or remote effect of these lawful transactions
upon competition between the railway companies could bring
them within the Federal Anti-Trust Act.
The mere fact that a contract has the effect of restraining
trade or suppressing competition in some degree does not
render it injurious to the public welfare and thus bring it within
the police power. Oregon Co. v. Winsor, 20 Wall. 64; Gibbs

U. S. 211, 246, the Anti-Trust Act concerns only those agree-
ments of which the direct and immediate effect is to restrain
commerce. The transaction now under review was lawful, and,
however considered, was not prohibited by the Anti-Trust Act,
because such restraint upon interstate trade or commerce, if
any, as it might impose, would be indirect, collateral and re-
mote.
This act is a criminal statute pure and simple and its meaning
and effect as now determined must also be its meaning and
effect when made the basis of a criminal proceeding. Con-
versely, the act should not receive such construction only as it
would receive upon the trial of those indicted for violating its
provision. Criminal intent is essential to constitute a crime,
and the testimony bearing thereon is always a question for the
jury. People v. Wiman, 148 N. Y. 29, 33; People v. Flack, 125
N. Y. 324, 334.
Regardless of all other considerations presented on this argu-
ment, the judgment under review must be reversed unless it is
to be established as matter of law that the mere possession of
the power to control all the means of transportation of two
competing interstate commerce carriers operates as the effec-
tual exercise of such power and directly affects interstate com-
merce, notwithstanding the fact that such power has never
been exercised by its possessors, and the further fact that it is
perfectly practicable for them to exercise it in a perfectly
proper way. Support for the proposition now under review
was sought below in the Pearsall case, 161 U. S. 646, 674, the
Joint Traffic case, the Traas-Missouri case and the Addsyton
