WHITE, J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, PECrIm, HOLMES, JJ., dissenting. 193 IT. S.
the carrying on of interstate commerce over the roads which
were parties to the agreement were contained in it, and section 3
provided as follows:
"A committee shall be appointed to establish rates, rules
and regulations on the traffic subject to this association, and
to consider changes therein, and make rules for meeting the
competition of outside lines. Their conclusions, when unai-
mous, shall be made effective when they so order, but if they
differ the question at issue shall be referred to the managers
of the lines parties hereto; and if they disagree it shall be
arbitrated in the manner provided in article VII."
The government sought to dissolve the association on the
ground that the agreement restrained commerce between the
States, and therefore was in violation of the Anti-Trust Act..
On the hearing in this court, as the agreement directly related
in many particulars to interstate transportation and the charge,
to be made therefor, it was conceded on all hands that it em-
braced subjects which came within the power of Congress to
regulate commerce. The contentions on behalf of the asso-
ciation were these: First. That the movement of interstate
commerce by railroads was not within the Anti-Trust Act,
since Congress had regulated that subject by the interstate
commerce act, and did not intend to amplify its provisions in
any respect by the subsequent enactment of the Anti-Trust
Law. Second. That even if this were not the case, and the
movement of interstate commerce by railroads was affected
by the Anti-Trust Statute, the particular agreement in question
did not violate the act, because the agreement did not unrea-
sonably restrain interstate commerce. Both these conten-
tions were decided against the association, the court holding
that the Anti-Trust Act did embrace interstate carriage by
railroad corporations, and as that act prohibited any contract
in restraint of interstate commerce, it hence embraced all
contracts of that character, whether they were reasonable or
unreasonable.
The same subject was considered in a subsequent case,

NORTHERN SECURITIES CO. v. UNITED STATES. 387
193 U. S. WHITE, J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, PECKHAM, HOLMES, JJ., dissenting.
United States v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 U. S. 505. In
that case also there was no question that the agreement be-
tween the railroads related to the movement of interstate com-
merce, but it was insisted that the particular agreement there
involved did not seek to fix rates, but only to secure the con-
tinuation of just rates which had already been fixed, and hence
was not within the Anti-Trust Law. If this were held not to
be true, a reconsideration of the questions decided in the
Freight Association case was invoked. The court reviewed
and reiterated the rulings made in the FreiihtA ssociation case
and held that the particular agreement in question came within
them.
I mention these two last cases not because they are apposite
to the case in hand, for they are not, since the contracts which
were involved in them confessedly concerned interstate com-
merce, whilst in this case the sole question is whether the
ownership of stock in competing railroads does involve inter-
state commerce. The cases are referred to in connection with
the decisions previously cited, because, taken together, they
illustrate the distinction which this court has always main-
tained between the power of Congress over interstate com-
merce and its want of authority to regulate subjects not em-
braced within that grant. The same distinction is aptly shown
in subsequent cases.
Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578, involved whether a
particular agreement entered into between persons carrying
on the business of selling cattle on commission, exclusively at
the Kansas City stock yards was valid. At those yards cattle
were received in vast numbers through the channels of in-
terstate commerce, and from thence were distributed through
such channels. For these reasons the business of those engaged
exclusively in the sale of cattle on the stock yards was asserted
to be interstate commerce and within the power of Congress to
regulate. In the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice
Peckham, it was at the outset said (p. 586):
"The relief sought in this case is based exclusively on the

act of Congress approved July 2, 1890, c. 647, entitled 'An act
to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and
monopolies,' commonly spoken of as the Anti-Trust Act. 26
Stat. 209.
"The act has reference only to that trade or commerce which
exists, or may exist, among the several States or with foreign
nations, and has no application whatever to any other trade
or commerce.
"The question meeting us at the threshold, therefore, in this
case is, what is th6 nature of the business of the defendants,
and are the by-laws, or any subdivision of them above referred
to, in their direct effect in restraint of trade or commerce
among the several States or with foreign nations; or does the
case made by the bill and answer show that any one of the
above defendants has monopolized, or attempted to monopo-
lize, or combined or conspired with other persons to monopolize,
any part of the trade or commerce among the several States
or with foreign nations?"
Proceeding, then, to consider the agreement, it was pointed
out that the contention that the sale of cattle on the stock yards
constituted interstate commerce was without merit. The dis-
tinction between interstate commerce as such and the power
to make contracts and to buy and sell property was clearly
stated, and because of that distinction the agreement was held
not to be within the act of Congress, because that act could
and did only relate to interstate commerce.
And on the day the decision just referred to was announced
another case under the Anti-Trust Act was decided. Anderson
v. United States, 171 U. S. 604. The difference between that
case and the Hopkins case was thus stated by Mr. Justice
Peckham, in delivering the opinion of the court (p. 612):
"This case differs from that of Hopkins v. United States,
supra, in the fact that these defendants are themselves pur-
chasers of cattle on the market, while the defendants in the
Hopkins case were only commission merchants who sold the
cattle upon commission as a compensation for their services.
