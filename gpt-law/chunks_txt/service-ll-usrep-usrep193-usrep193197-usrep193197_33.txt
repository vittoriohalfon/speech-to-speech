NORTHERN SECURITIES CO. v. UNITED STATES. 293
193 U. S. Brief of Mr. Stetson and Mr. Willcox for Morgan and others.
Pipe case. The proposition, however, can be deduced from
these cases only by what to us seems violent distortion. As
to the case first cited, see Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co.,
123 Fed. Rep. 692, 705.
In the other cases and also in cases decided by the Circuit
Court and Court of Appeals, the combinations had been formed
by corporations or individuals engaged in business independ-
ently of one another and they had agreed to regulate their
prices or mode of carrying on their business by the rules of the
combination. United States v. Jellico Coal Co., 46 Fed. Rep.
432; United States v. California Coal Dealers Association, 85
Fed. Rep. 252; Chesapeake Fuel Co. v. United States, 115 Fed.
Rep. 610; Gibbs v. McNeeler, 118 Fed. Rep. 120.
It has been held repeatedly that such restraints as result
from the sale or the purchase of property are not within the
provisions of anti-trust statutes. Indeed, it is the settled law
that the transfer of a business is not illegal because it restrains
trade, even by an express covenant. Oregon Co. v. Winsor,
20 Wall. 64; Union Co. v. Connolly, 99 Fed. Rep. 354, aff'd
184 U. S. 540; Fisheries Co. v. Lennen, 116 Fed. Rep. 217;
Harrison v. Glucose Co., 116 Fed. Rep. 304; Hodge v. Sloan,
107 N. Y. 244; Leslie v. Lorillard, 110 N. Y. 519; Tode v. Gross,
127 N. Y. 480; Oakes v. CattaraugusC o., 143 N. Y. 430; Water-
town Co. v. Pool, 51 Hun, 157, approved 127 N. Y. 485; Wood
v. Whitehead Co., 165 N. Y. 545; Walsh v. Dwight, 40 App. Div.

App. Div. (N. Y.) 223; S. C., 175 N. Y. 1; Diamond Match Co.
v. Roeber, 106 N. Y. 473.
So, too, it has been ruled precisely that the formation of
associations or corporations is not illegal, because the result
will be to restrain competition. Hopkins v. United States, 171
U. S. 578; Anderson v. United States, 171 U. S. 604; United States

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Brief of Mr. Stetson and Mr. Willcox for Morgan and others. 193 U. S.
Rep. 213; Trenton Potteries Co. v. Olyphant, 58 N. J. Eq. 507;
Mogul S. S. Co. v. McGregor, App. Cas. (1892) 25; Lough v.

S. W. Rep. (N1o.) 737.
It is very doubtful whether in any case the second section
of the act applies to railroads. Prof. Langdell, 16 Harvard
Law Review, 545, June, 1903; Mr. Thorndike, Pamphlet, 1903,
The Merger Case, p. 32.
In the Joint Traffic cases the court did not specifically define
"monopoly," but said that it had the meaning given to it in
the body of the Anti-Trust Act, which was not involved in the
Pearsallc ase, and the decision there cannot now be urged upon
this court as a limitation upon its freedom of construction of
the statute. See Laredo v. International Bridge Co., 66 Fed.
Rep. 246.
Obviously, a consolidation of two railroads authorized by
the laws of every State which they enter would not be con-
demned as constituting a monopoly; nor would a purchase of
all the stock of one road by a competing road similarly au-
thorized be so condemned; nor would a combination to induce
the legislatures of the several States to authorize such a con-
solidation or such a purchase. It cannot be that, in prohibit-
ing monopolies, the Congress intended to forbid these familiar
processes of railroad amalgamation, and if, when authorized
by state law, the consummated act is not a monopoly, it
would not be such merely because it has not been so author-
ized.
The construction claimed would make the statute unconsti-
tutional because it would deprive the Securities Company of
its property without due process of law. Corporations are
entitled to the same constitutional protection of their property
rights as natural persons. Minneapolis Railway Co. v. Beck-
with, 129 U. S. 26; Carrington Turnpike Co. v. Sandford, 164

of San Malteo v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., 13 Fed. Rep. 722,
745, 760.
This constitutional provision protects the right to acquire
property-equally with the right-to hold the same after it
has been acquired. Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366, 391;
State v. Goodwill, 33 W. Va. 179; State v. Julow, 129 Mis-
souri, 163, 173; Knight Case, 156 U. S. 1.
The Pearsall Case, 161 U. S. 646, distinctly recognizes that
a natural person would be entirely at liberty to buy all the
shares which his means permitted of the stock of the North-
ern Pacific Railway Company and the Great Northern Rail-
way Company. The State creating a corporation might limit
its power in this respect, but Congress had no such general
authority to cut down the powers granted by the States to
their corporations, merely because they are artificial instead
of natural persons. Therefore, it is obvious that a corpora-
tion having authority by its charter to make such purchases
cannot, merely because it is a corporation, be prevented from
so doing without depriving it of that right without due proc-
ess of law.
As construed and applied by the Circuit Court the Anti-Trust
Act is unconstitutional, in that it discriminates between per-
sons in the matter of property rights and privileges on grounds
that are purely arbitrary and are without justification in reason.
The power to suppress competition between two compet-
ing interstate railroad companies being always existent and
under the theory of the Circuit Court always attaching to a
majority of the shares of both, whether owned by one per-
son or by several, the Anti-Trust Act, if understood as intended
to do away with such power, should be enforced so as to pre-
vent any one person, as much as any two or more per-
sons, from acquiring stock in both of such competing coin-
panies.
If as construed by the court below, the Anti-Trust Act
arbitrarily and without reason discriminates between persons
in the matter of their property, rights and privileges, the act
