Opinion of the Court. 197 U. S.
U. S. 505; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S.
197; Swift*& Co. v. United States, 196 U. S. 375.
In Smiley v. Kansas, decided at this term, 196 U.. S. 447,
a statute of Kansas is passed on which is identical in effect,
and even in words, in all that concerns the present- contro-
versy, with the Texas statutes. The statute was assailed as
"an unwarranted attempt upon the part of the legislature to
limit the rights of the individual in the matter of contracting
and dealing with his fellow-men." The right which Smiley
claimed was to combine with certain grain dealers, persons,
companies and corporations, who were competitors, to pool
and fix the price of grain in the town of Bison, and to prevent
competition in the purchase and sale of grain at that place.
We--followed the ruling of the. Supreme Court of the State in
holding that the combination was within the prohibition of the
statute; we concurred -with that court in deciding that the pro-
hibition was a valid exercise of the police power of the State.
It follows that the statutes of Texas do not deprive the oil
company of its property without due process of law.
Next, as to the effect of the statutes.
The act of May 25, 1899, omits the discriminatory provisions
of the prior acts, but, it is contended, that as the latter act is
declared to be cumulative of the prior acts their discrimina-
tions are preserved and continued, and that under the Code
provisions the company may be criminally prosecuted, and
that the excepted classes of the acts of, 1889 and 1895 are
exempt from prosecution. It is further urged whether such
discrimination results from the statutes is for us. to determine
independently of. what views the courts of the State may
entertain of them and their relations.
Upon the last contention depends the mode of approaching
the other, and we will dispose of it first. We cannot assent
to it. There are cases in which we determine for ourselves the
meaning of a state law, but this is not one of them. I The con-
tention of the company is that the statutes of the State dis-
criminate against it; in other words, deny it the equal protec-

tion of the law, by forbidding it from loing what they permit
others to do in similar eireunstmees punish ikta cts and
exempt from punishment tle same acts when (hne by others.
But the courts of the State are the tribunals appointed to
administer the statutes and impose their penalties, and to do
so they must necessarily interpret them. In other words,
they are the tribunals to declare the meaning of the statutes,
and if in declaring it they make the statutes discriminatory
then may the statutes become unconstitutional. Olsen v.
Smith, 195 U. S. 332.
What has the Supreme Court of Texas said of the statutes?
The Court of Civil Appeals in the case at bar expresse(t the
following .view:
"The trial court did not err in overruling appellant's de-
murrers. While it has been correctly held that certain provi-
sions of the anti-trust statutes are unconstitutional, the Su-
preme Court, in the case of The Slate of Texas v. The Shippers'
Compress & Warehouse Co., 69 S. W. Rep. 61, relying upon
the case of The Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. The State of Texas,
177 U. S. 28, holds that so much of these statutes that au-
thorize the canceling and forfeiture of a charter or permit to
do business within the State of Texas are valid, and are not
in violation of the constitution."
The Supreme Court refused a writ of error, an(l thereby, as
we understand the local rule to be, approved the views of the
Court of Civil Appeals. Subsequently the Supreme Court ex-
pressed itself explicitly in State of Texas v. Shippers' Compress
and Warehouse Company, 95 Texas, 603, and State of Texas
v. Laredo Ice Company, 96 Texas, 461.
The object in State of Texas v. Shippers' Compress and
Warehouse Company was to forfeit the charter of the compress
company for violating. the Anti-Trust Law of 1895, in that the
incorporators combined "to restrict aids to commerce." The
law was attacked as unconstitutional. To the contention the
court said:
"The defendant insists that the law is unconstitutional,

therefore void in whole, and will not support the action to
forfeit the charter. Upon the same objection we held the
Anti-Trust Law of 1889 to be constitutional, and there is no
such difference between the two laws as would affect the de-
cision of this question. We believe that our decision is cor-
rect; that the law is not in contravention of the constitution
of the State nor of the United States. Honck v. Brewing
Assn., 88 Texas, 189."
The court then referred to Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe
Co., 184 U. S. 540, and in submission to its authority held the
law of 1895, so far as it came within the terms of that case,
invalid, and would not support an action by the State to
recover a penalty for a violation of the law, nor would it, in
suits between corporations and individuals, support a defense
based upon the fact that the right of action originated in
violation of the Anti-Trust Law. "But," the court remarked,
"to the extent that the statute of this State is not embraced
in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, we
shall adhere to our former decision that it is constitutional
and valid, and therefore enforcible by the State."
That is, the court decided the act of 1895 was valid to the
extent that it authorized the State to revoke the license of a
foreign corporation and to forfeit the charter of a domestic
corporation. The other provisions of the act were held in-
valid, and the right to make this distinction was based on
Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas.
State of Texas v. Laredo Ice Co. was instituted to recover
penalties for the violation of the Anti-Trust Law of 1899. The
ice company -was a domestic corporation, and it was proceeded
against for having formed a combination to regulate and fix
prices. In defense, the company asserted the unconstitu-
tionality of the act.
It is provided in section 14 of the act of 1899 that the pro-
visions of preceding sections and the fines and penalties pro-
vided for violations of the act shall be held and construed to
be cumulative of all laws now in force in the State. It was
