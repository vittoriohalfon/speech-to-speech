the plain meaning of its words; for it has been long and well
settled that such statutes must be construed strictly. Yet
the evident intention of the legislature ought not to be defeated
by a forced and overstrict construction. 5 Wheat. 95." So,
in The Schooner Industry, 1 Gall. 114, 117, Mr. Justice Story
said: "We are undoubtedly bound to construe penal statutes
strictly; and not to extend them beyond their obvious meaning
by strained inferences. On the other hand, we are bound to
interpret them according to the manifest import of the words,
and to hold all cases which are within the words and the mis-
chiefs to be within the remedial influence of the statute." In
another case the same eminent jurist said: "I agree to that
rule in its true and sober sense; and that is, that penal statutes
are not to be enlarged by implication or extended to cases not
obviously within their words and purport. . . . In short,
it appears to me that the proper course in all these cases is to
search out and follow the true intent of the legislature, and to
adopt that sense of the words which harmonizes the best with
the context, and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent
policy and objects of the legislature." United States v. Winn,
3 Sumner, 209, 211, 212. In People v. Bartow, 6 Cowen, 290,
the highest court of New York said: "Although a penal statute
is to be construed strictly, the court are not to disregard the
plain intent of the legislature. Among other things, it is well
settled that a statute which is made for the good of the public,
ought, although it be penal, to receive an equitable construc-
tion." So, in Commonwealth v. Martin, 17 Massachusetts, 359,
362, the highest court of Massachusetts said: "If a statute,
creating or increasing a penalty, be capable of two construc-
tions, undoubtedly that construction which operates in favor
of life or liberty is to be adopted; but it is not justifiable in
this, any more than in any other case, to imagine ambiguities,
merely that a lenient construction may be adopted. If such
were the privilege of a court, it would be easy to obstruct
the public will in almost every statute enacted; for it rarely
happens that one is so precise and exact in its terms, as to

preclude the exercise of ingenuity in raising doubts about its
construction." There are cases almost without number in
this country and in England to the same effect.
Guided by these long-established rules of construction, it is
manifest that if the Anti-Trust Act is held not to embrace a
case such as is nox; before us, the plain intention of the legis-
lative branch of the Government will be defeated. If Congress
has not, by the words used in the act, described this and like
cases, it would, we apprehend, be impossible to find words that
would describe them. This, it must be remembered, is a suit
in equity, instituted by authority of Congress "to prevent and
restrain violations of the act," ยง 4; and the court, in virtue of
a well settled rule governing proceedings in equity, may mould
its decree so as to accomplish practical results-such results
as law and justice demand. The defendants have no just
cause to complain of the decree, in matter of law, and it should
be affirmed.
The judgment of the court is that the (lecree below be and
hereby is affirmed, with liberty to the Circuit Court to proceed
in the execution of its decree as the circumstances may require.

MR. JusTIcE BRwEwn, concurring.
I cannot assent to all that is said in the opinion just an-
nounced, and believe that the importance of the case and the
questions involved justify a brief statement of my views.
First, let me say that while I was with the majority of the
court in the decision in United States v. Freight Association,
166 U. S. 290, followed by the cases of United States v. Joint
Traffic Association, 171 U. S. 505, Addyston Pipe & Steel Com-
pany v. United States, 175 U. S. 211, and Montague & Co. v.
Louj, 193 U. S. 38, decided at the present term, and while
a further examination (which has been induced by the able and
exhaustive arguments of counsel in the present case) has not
disturbed the conviction that those cases were rightly decided,

I think that in some respects the reasons given for the judg-
ments cannot be sustained. Instead of holding that the Anti-
Trust Act included all contracts, reasonable or unreasonable,
in restraint of interstate trade, the ruling should have been that
the coiftracts there presented were unreasonable restraints of
interstate trade, and as such within the scope of the act. That
act, as appears from its title, was leveled at only "unlawful
restraints and monopolies." Congress did not intend to reach
and destroy those minor contracts in partial restraint of trade
which the long course of decisions at common law had affirmed
were reasonable and ought to be upheld. The purpose rather
was to place a statutory prohibition with prescribed penalties
and remedies upon those contracts which were in direct re-
straint of trade, unreasonable and against public policy.
Whenever a departure from common law rules and definitions
is claimed, the purpose to make the departure should be clearly
shown. Such a purpose does not appear and such a departure
was not intended.
Further, the general language of the act is also limited by the
power which each individual has to manage his own property
and determine the place and manner of its investment. Free-
dom of action in these respects is among the inalienable rights
of every citizen. If, applying this thought to the present case,
it appeared that Mr. Hill was the owner of a. majority of the
stock in the Great Northern Railway Company he could not
by any act of Congress be deprived of the right of investing
his surplus means in the purchase of stock of the Northern
Pacific Railway Company, although such purchase might tend
to vest in him through that ownership a control over both
companies. In other words, the right, which all other citizens
had, of purchasing Northern Pacific stock could not be denied
to him by Congress because of his ownership of stock in the
Great Northern Company. Such was the ruling in Pearsall
v. Great Northern Railway, 161 U. S. 646, in which this court
said (p..671), in reference to the right of the stockholders of
the Great Northern Company to purchase the stock of the
