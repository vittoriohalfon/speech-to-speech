Burlington Company and its connections were geographically
as stated in the petition, and that some of said lines compete

especially valuable to the agricultural and mineral products of
the northwest, and also because the Burlington system serves
a large and growing territory, and the purchase was deemed

State or of the United States, and was not in violation of any
such law.
