founded our government upon an enduring basis of right,
principle and of limitation of power. Destroy the principles
and the limitations which they impose, and I am unable to
say that conduct may not, when unrestrained, give rise to
action doing violence to the great truths which the destroyed
principles embodied.
The fallacy of all the contentions of the Government is, to
my mind, illustrated by the summing up of the case for the
Government made in the argument at bar. The right to ac-
quire and own the stock of competing railroads involves, says
that summing up, the power of an individual "to do" (italics
mine) absolutely as he pleases with his own, whilst the claim
of the Government is that the right of the owner of prop-
erty "to do" (italics mine) as he pleases with his own may
be controlled in the public interest by legitimate legislation.
But the case involves the right to acquire and own, not the
right "to do" (italics mine). Confusing the two gives rise to
the errors which it has been my endeavor to point out. Un-
doubtedly the States possess power over corporations, created
by them, to permit or forbid consolidation, whether accom-
plished by stock ownership or otherwise, to forbid one corpo-
ration from holding stock in another, and to impose on this or
other subjects such regulations as may be deemed best. Gen-
erally speaking, however, the right to do these things springs
alone from the fact that the corporation is created by the
States, and holds its rights subject to the conditions attached
to the grant, or to such regulations as the creator, the State,
may lawfully impose upon its creature, the corporation. More-
over, irrespective of the relation of creator and creature, it is,
of course, true in a general sense that government possesses
the authority to regulate, within certain just limits, what an
owner may do with his property. But the first power which
arises from the authority of a grantor to exact conditions in
making a grant or to regulate the conduct of the grantee
gives no sanction to the proposition that a government, irre-
spective of its power to grant, has the general authority to

limit the character and quantity of property which may be ac-
quired and owned. And the second power, the general gov-
ernmental one, to reasonably control the use of property,
affords io foundation for the proposition that there exists in
government a power to limit the quantity and character of
property which may be acquired and owned. The difference
between the two is that which exists between a free and con-
stitutional government restrained by law and an absolute
government unrestrained by any of the principles which are
necessary for the perpetuation of society and the protection
of life, liberty and property.
It cannot be denied that the sum of all just governmental
power was enjoyed by the States and the people before the
Constitution of the United States was formed. None of that
power was abridged by that instrument except as restrained
by constitutional safeguards, and hence none was lost by the
adoption of the Constitution. The Constitution, whilst dis-
tributing the preexisting authority, preserved it all. With
the full power of the States over corporations created by
them and with their authority in respect to local legislation,
and with power in Congress over interstate commerce carried
to its fullest degree, I cannot conceive that if these powers,
admittedly possessed by both, be fully exerted a remedy can-
not be provided fully adequate to suppress evils which may
arise from combinations deemed to be injurious. This must be
true unless it be concluded that by the effect of the mere dis-
tribution of power made by the Constitution partial impo-
tency of governmental authority has resulted. But if this be
conceded, arguendo, the Constitution itself has pointed out
the method by which, if changes are needed, they may be
brought about. No remedy, in my opinion, for any supposed
or real infirmity can be afforded by disregarding the Constitu-
tion, by destroying the lines which separate state and Federal
authority, and by implying the existence of a power which is
repugnant to all those fundamental rights of life, liberty and
property, upon which just government must rest.

HOLMES, J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, WHITE, PECKHAM, JJ., dissenting. 193 U. S.
If, however, the question of the power of Congress be con-
ceded, and the assumption as to the meaning of the Anti-Trnst
Act which has been indulged in for the purpose of consider-
ing that power be put out of view, it would yet remain to be
determined whether the Anti-Trust Act embraced the acquisi-
tion and ownership of the stock in question by the Northern
Securities Company. It is unnecessary for me, however, to
state the reasons which have led me to the conclusion that the
act, when properly interpreted, does not embrace the acqui-
sition and ownership of such stock, since that subject is con-
sidered in an opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes, which exJ)lains
the true interpretation of the statute, as it is understood by
me, more clearly that I would be able to do.
Being of the opinion, for the reasons heretofore given, that
Congress was without power to regulate the acquisition and
ownership of the stock in question by the Northern Securities
Company, and because I think even if there were such power
in Congress, it has not been exercised by the Anti-Trust Act,
as is shown in the opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes, I dissent.
I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE
PEcKmaii and MR. JUSTICE HOLMES, concur in this dissent.

TICE, M. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE PECKHAMI, (is-

I am unable to agree with the judgment of the majority of
the court, and although I think it useless and undesirable, as
a rule, to express dissent, I feel bound to do so in this case and
to give my reasons for it.
Great cases like hard cases make bad law. For great cases
are called great, not by reason of their real importance in
shaping the law of the future, but because of some accident of
immediate overwhelming interest which appeals to the feel-
ings and distorts the judgment. These immediate interests
