Opinion of the Court.
a contract or promise, which can be so bnforced, that courts of
equity will recognize for that purpose the existence of an equi-
table lien. In such case the lien is impressed upon funds or prop-
erty which, belonging -to the promisor, were the very fuhds or
property which constituted the subject-matter of the contract
or to which the contract or promise related. It is essential,
therefore, that the funds or other property, which are to be
charged with the lien, should have, either at the time of the con-
tract or afterwards, and while it was still unperformed, belonged
to the party against whom the contract is to be so enforced, and
be so identified, even though at the time of suit the said funds
or property have come into the hands of volunteers, or of others
who 'may be affedted with notice. There must, therefore, exist
a contract by the party owning; either in pr'senti or in expect-
ancy, the property sought to-be charged, which directly or by
necessary implication, expresses the intention to charge such
property with the lien, in favor of the other party to the con-
tract. . . It is not pretended that there was any contract
between Kann or the appellant company and the complainant
to insure for its benefit, or any promise or declaration of inten-
tion, upon any or no consideration, that they, or either of them,
would so insure, or that policies or funds arising therefrom should
be assigned or charged with a lien in its favor. The. first essen-
tial requisite to an equitable lien, as above described, is, there-
fore, entirely wanting. There is no contractual relation of any
kind between the mortgagee and the appellant," (respondent in
this court) "in whose name, and for whose sole benefit, these
policies of insurance were taken out. If such a lien, therefore,
exists on these insurance funds, in favor of the complainant, it
must be on other grounds than these ordinary and well-under-
stood ones. This is not the case of a mortgagee claiming an
insurance taken out by the mortgagor, who had covenanted to
insure for the benefit of the mortgagee; nor is it the case of
such mortgagee claiming such insurance funds, when they had
come into the hands of third persons, ' who are either volunteers,
or who take the estate. [the insurance funds] on which the lien
is agreed to be given with notice of the stipulation.' The con-.
plainant does not claim that the funds due on policies taken out

by the mortgagor, and which the mortgagor is held to have
promised that he would assign to the mortgagee, have come
into the possession of the appellant (respondent), with notice,
and are, therefore, charged with a lien in favor of the mort-
gagee. Its claim is that the grantee of the equity of redemp-
tion, having taken the property expressly subject to the mort-
gage, which contained a covenant on the part of the mortgagor
to insure, on that ground alone came either under a direct obli-
gation to-insure the premises for the benefit of the.mortgagee,
or under an obligation to indemnify the mortgagor for his lia-
'bility under said covenant. But the property or ' estate' which
came to the hands of the appellant, as grantee of the equity of
redemptiob, was the mortgaged premises, subject to the mort-
gage. There is no difficulty in determining what that estate is
to be charged 'irith. The court here, however, is asked to im-
press a lien in favor of the mortgagee, not on this estate, but
upon funds which were never in any sense the property of the
mortgagor, and could never have -been the subject-matter of a
promise on its part. It is the first branch of the claim above
stated (i. e., the alleged direct Gbligation) that we are now con-
sidering."
We fail to see any contractual obligation on the part of the
defendants to insure for the benefit of the bondholders further
than we have stated, as indemnitors of the mortgagor for its
breach, if any, of its covenants.
The case of Wheeler v. Insurance Company, 101 U. S. 439,
isf ounded upon the existence of the obligation of the mortgagor
to insure, and it is said that under such circumstances the mort-
gagee will have an equitable lien upon the money due upon a
policy of insurance taken out by the mortgagor to the extent of
the mortgagee's interest in the property destroyed, and that
such equitable lien exists, although the contract provided that
in case of the mortgagor's failure to procure and assign that
insurance, the mortgagee might procure it at the mortgagor's
expense.
If the insurance had been taken out by this mortgagor com-
pany, even in its own name, we would have the same principle
as. decided in the last cited case, and- the complainant herein

might, as its counsel claim, have had an equitable lien upon the
moneys arising from such insurance to the extent of the loss
under the mortgage. But here is no such case. The mortgagor
did not insure after it lost title to the property' under the con-
veyance by its receiver to Kann, and the insurance that was pro-
cured was for the interest of the defendants in the property to
the exclusion, in terms, of the interest of the complainant. Al-
though the defendant bought subject to the mortgage and with
full knowledge of the insurance covenant, yet it held the prop-
erty subject only to an obligation on its part, at most, to in-
demnify the mortgagor on account of the mortgage debt or on
account of its covenant to insure, and we have seen that that
obligation, under the terms of this mortgage, was of no mate-
riality because by its terms the mortgagor was under no per-
sonal liability, and there was, therefore, no subject upon which
indemnity could rest.
If there is no contractual obligation arising from the terms
of the mortgage, and the taking of the deeds with an "under
and subject" clause, as above referred to then there must have
been some conduct on the part of the person to be, charged
which would estop him from setting up as a defence the lack of
such obligation. The complainant urges that the defendants
have been guilty of conduct which does estop them from deny-
ing their, liability. This is a different claim from that first re-
marked upon as to the treatment of defendants as receivers.
This claim is based upon a survey-of the whole conduct of de-
fendants in' connection with the mortgagor company and the
insurance upon the property. The record in-this case, in our
opinion, discloses no conduct on the part of the defendants
which esto.ps them or either of them from showing the lack of
any obligation on their part to apply any portion of the insur-
ance moneys to the payment of the bondholders. There has
been no wrecking of the mortgagor company by either or both
defendants, and neither has done anything depriving himself
or itself of any defence he or it might otherwise. have. In other
words, both defendants have, so far as this record shows, full lib-
efty to set up as a defence the wantof any contractual or other
obligation to insure. The opinion of the Circuit Court of Ap-
