OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
MR. JUSTICE BRnWER, concurring. 193 U. S.
Northern Pacific Railway Company: "Doubtless these stock-
holders could lawfully acquire by individual purchases a ma-
jority, or even the whole of the stock of the reorganized com-
pany, and thus possibly obtain its ultimate control; but the
companies would still remain separate corporations with no
interests, as such, in common."
But no such investment by a single individual of his means
is here presented. There was a combination by several indi-
viduals separately owning stock in two competing railroad
companies to place the control of both in a single corporation.
The purpose to combine and by combination destroy com-
petition existed before the organization of the corporation, the
Securities Company. That corporation, though nominally
having a capital stock of $400,000,000, had no means of its
own; $30,000 in cash was put into its treasury, but simply
for the expenses of organization. The organizers might just
as well have made the nominal stock a thousand millions as
four hundred, and the corporation would have been no richer
or poorer. A corporation, while by fiction of law recognized
for some purposes as a person and for purposes of jurisdiction
as a citizen, is not endowed with the inalienable rights of a
natural person. It is an artificial person, created and existing
only for the convenient transaction of business. In this case
it was a mere instrumentality by which separate railroad prop-
erties were combined under one control. That combination
is as direct a restraint of trade by destroying competition as
the appointment of a committee to regulate rates. The pro-
hibition of such a combination is not at all inconsistent with
the right of an individual to purchase stock. The transfer of
stock to the Securities Company was a mere incident, the
manner in which the combination to destroy competition and
thus unlawfully restrain trade was carried out.
If the parties interested in these two railroad companies can,
through the instrumentality of a holding corporation, place
both under one control, then in like manner, as was conceded
on the argument by one of the counsel for the appellants, could

the control of all the railroad companies in the country be
placed in a single corporation. Nor need this arrangement
for control stop with what has already been done. The holders
of $201,000,000 of stock in the Northern Securities Company
might organize another corporation to hold their stock in that
company, and the new corporation holding the majority of the
stock in the Northern Securities Company and acting in obedi-
ence to the wishes of a majority of its stockholders would
control the action of the Securities Company and through it
the action of the two railroad companies, and this process
might be extended until a single corporation whose stock was
owned by three or four parties would be in practical control
of both roads, or, having before us the possibilities of com-
bination, the control of the whole transportation system of the
country. I cannot believe that to be a reasonable or lawful
restraint of trade.
Again, there is by this suit no interference with state control.
It is a recognition rather than. a disregard of its action. This
merging of control and destruction of competition was not
authorized, but specifically prohibited by the State which
created one of the railroad companies, and within whose
boundaries the lines of both were largely located and much
of their business transacted. The purpose and policy of the
State are therefore enforced by the decree. So far as the work
of the two railroad companies was interstate commerce, it was
subject to the control of Congress, and its purpose and policy
were expressed in the act under which this suit was brought.
It must also be remembered that under present conditions
a single railroad is, if not a legal, largely a practical, monopoly,
and the arrangement by which the control of these two com-
peting roads was merged in a single corporation broadens and
extends such monopoly. I cannot look upon it as other than
an unreasonable combination in restraint of interstate com-
merce-one in conflict with state law and within the letter and
spirit of the statute and the power of Congress. Therefore I
concur in the judgment of affirmance.

OCTOBER TERM, 190.
WHITE, J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, PeoKEAM-, HOLMES, JJ., dissenting. 193 U. S.
I have felt constrained to make these observations for fear
that the broad and sweeping language of the opinion of the
court might tend to unsettle legitimate business enterprises,
stifle or retard wholesome business activities, encourage im-
proper disregard of reasonable contracts and invite unnecessary
litigation.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom concurred MR. CiinF
JUSTICE FULLER, MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, and MR. JUSTICE
HOLMES, dissenting.
The Northern Securities Company is a New Jersey corpo-
ration; the Great Northern Railway Company, a Minnesota
one; and the Northern Pacific Railway Company, a Wisconsin
corporation. Whilst in the argument at bar the Govern-
ment referred to the subject, nevertheless it expressly dis-
claimed predicating any claim for relief upon the fact thalt ihe
predecessor in title of the Northern Pacific Railway Company
was a corporation created by act of Congress. That fact,
therefore, may be eliminated.
The facts essential to be borne in mind to understand my
point of view, without going into details, are as follows: The
lines of the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern Railway
companies are both transcontinental, that is, trunk lines to
the Pacific Ocean, and in some aspects are conceded to be
competing. Mr. Morgan and Mr. Hill and a few personis im-
mediately associated with them separately acquired and owned
capital stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, ag-
gregating a majority thereof. Mr. Hill and others associ-
ated with him owned, in the same manner, about one-third of
the capital stock of the Great Northern Railway Company,
the balance of the stock being distributed among about eight-
een hundred stockholders. Uthough Mr. Hill and his im-
mediate associates owned only one-third of the stock, the con-
fidence reposed in Mr. Hill was such that, through proxies,
his influence was dominant in the affairs of that company.
