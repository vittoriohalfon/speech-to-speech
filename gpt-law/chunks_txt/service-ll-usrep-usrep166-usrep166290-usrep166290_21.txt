Gas Co., 130 U. S. 396, 409. As it is unnecessary here to
enter into a detailed examination of the cases, I append in the
margin a reference to decisions of some of the state courts
and to several writers on the subject of contracts in restraint
of trade, by whom the doctrine is reviewed and the authorities
very fully referred to.'
It follows from the foregoing statement that at common
law contracts which only partially restrain trade, to use the
precise language of Maule, Justice, in Rannie v. Irvine, 7 Man.
& G. 969, 978, were "an exception engrafted upon that rule,"
that is, the rule as to contracts in restraint of trade, "and that
the exception is in furtherance of the rule itself." I submit,
also, manifestly that the further development of the doctrine
by which it was decided that if a contract was reasonable it
would not be held to be included within contracts in restraint
of trade, although such contract might, in some measure, pro-
duce such an effect, was also an exception to the general rule as
to the invalidity of contracts in restraint of trade. The theory,
then, that the words restraint of trade define and embrace all
such contracts without reference to whether they are reason-
able, amounts substantially to saying that, by the common law
and the adjudged American cases, certain classes of contracts
were carved out of and excepted from the general rule, and yet
were held to remain embraced within the general rule from
which they were removed. But the obvious conflict wvhich is
shown by this contradictory result to which the contention
leads rests not upon the mere form of statement but upon the

reason of things. This will, I submit, be shown by a very
brief analysis of the reasons by which partial restraints were
held not to be embraced in contracts in restraint of trade,
and by which ultimately all reasonable contracts were like-
wise decided not to be so embraced. That is to say, that the
reasoning by which the exceptions were created conclusively
shows the error of contending that the words contracts in
restraint of trade continued to embrace those reasonable con-
tracts which those words no longer described.
It is perhaps true that the principle by which contracts in
restraint of the freedom of the subject or of trade were held
to be illegal was first understood to embrace all contracts
which in any degree accomplished these results. But as trade
developed it came to be understood that if contracts which
only partially restrained the freedom of the subject or of
trade were embraced in the rule forbidding contracts in re-
straint of trade, both the freedom of contract and trade itself
would be destroyed. Hence, from the reason of things, arose
the distinction that where contracts operated only a partial
restraint of the freedom of contract or of trade they were not
in contemplation of law contracts in restraint of trade. And
it was this conception also which, in its final aspect, led to the
knowledge that reason was to be the criterion by which it was
to be determined whether a contract which, in some measure,
restrained the freedom of contract and of trade, was in reality,
when considered in all its aspects, a contract of that character
or one which was necessary to the freedom of contract and of
trade. To define, then, the words "in restraint of trade" as
embracing every contract which in any degree produced that
effect would be violative of reason, because it would include
all those contracts which are the very essence of trade, and
would be equivalent to saying that there should be no trade,
and therefore nothing to restrain. The dilemma which would
necessarily arise from defining the words "contracts in re-
straint of trade" so as to destroy trade by rendering illegal
the contracts upon which trade depends, and yet presuppos-
ing that trade would continue and should not be restrained, is
shown by an argument advanced, and which has been con-

pelled by the exigency of the premise upon which it is based.
Thus, after insisting that the word " every" is all-embracing, it
is said from the necessity of things it will not be held to apply
to covenants in restraint of trade which are collateral to a
sale of property, because not "supposed" to be within the
letter or spirit of the statute. But how, I submit, can it be held
that the words "every contract in restraint of trade" embrace
all such contracts, and yet at the same time be said that cer-
tain contracts of that nature are not included? The asserted
exception not only destroys the rule which is relied on, but it
rests upon no foundation of reason. It must either result from
the exclusion of particular classes of contracts, whether they
be reasonable or not, or it must arise from the fact that the
contracts referred to are merely collateral contracts. But
many collateral contracts may contain provisions which make
them unreasonable. The exception which is relied upon,
therefore, as rendering possible the existence of trade to be
restrained is either arbitrary or it is unreasonable.
But, admitting arguendo the correctness of the proposition
by which it is sought to include every contract, however
reasonable, within the inhibition of the law, the statute,
considered as a whole, shows, I think, the error of the con-
struction placed upon it. Its title is "An act to protect trade
and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies."
The word "unlawful "7 clearly distinguishes between contracts
in restraint of trade which are lawful and those which are
not. In other words, between those which are unreasonably
in restraint of trade, and consequently invalid, and those
which are 'reasonable and hence lawful. When, therefore,
in the very title of the act the well-settled distinction be-
tween lawful and unlawful contracts is broadly marked, how
can an interpretation be correct which holds that all contracts,
whether lawful or not, are included in its provisions? Whilst
it is true that the title of an act cannot be used to destroy the
plain import of the language found in its body, yet when a
literal interpretation will work out wrong or injury, or where
the words of the statute are ambiguous, the title may be re-
sorted to as an instrument of construction. In United State8
