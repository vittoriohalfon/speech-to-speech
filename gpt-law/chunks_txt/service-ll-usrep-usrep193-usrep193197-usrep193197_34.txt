Brief of Mr. Stetson and Mr. Wilicox for Morgan and others. 193 U. S.
is beyond the power of Congress as clearly as it would be be-
yond the power of any state legislature.
"Liberty," as used in the Fifth Amendment to the Con-
stitution means not merely bodily liberty-freedom from
physical duress, but in effect comprehends substantially all
those personal and civil rights of the citizen which it is meant
to place beyond the power of the general government to
destroy or impair. Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 122,
127; Munn v. Illinois, 94 UT. S. 113, 142; People v. Walsh,
117 N. Y. 60; Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent Co., 111 U. S.
746; Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578; United States v.
Joint Traffic Association, 171 U. S. 505, 572; Addyston Pipe &
Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U. S. 211, 228; Bertholj v. O'Reilly,
74 N. Y. 509; In re Jacobs, 98 N. Y. 98; People v. Gillson, 109
N. Y. 389; People v. King, 110 N. Y. 418; Godcharles v. Wige-
man, 113 Pa. St. 431. And see Regina v. Druitt, 10 (lox C. C.
592, 600.
It follows that, as used in the Fifth Constitutional Amend-
ment, "liberty" includes equality of rights under the law and
secures citizens similarly situated against discriminations be-
tween them which are arbitrary and without foundation in
reason. United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. . 542, 554; Yick
Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 369; Gulf, Colorado & Santa
FdRy. Co. v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150, 160.
Hence, the principles affirmed and acted upon by this court
in applying the Fourteenth Amendment to state legislation,
are equally applicable to legislation by Congress, and, as con-
strued by the court below, the Anti-Trust Act is invalid as
trespassing upon the "liberty" of citizens, by denying them
equality of rights and discriminating between them in the
matter of their property rights, arbitrarily and without reason.
Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards, 183 U. S. 106; Conn olly
v. Union Sewer Co., 184 U. S. 540; Barbier v. Connolly, 113
U. S. 27, 31.
As construed and applied by the Circuit Court, the statute
is unconstitutional because without due process of law, it

would deprive these defendants and all others who sold to the
Securities Company of their property. If there were any
prohibitions on the companies it would not apply to their
stockholders. A corporation and its stockholders are different
entities. Pullman Co. v. Missouri Pacific, 115 U. S. 587;
Watson v. Bonfils, 116 Fed. Rep. 157; American Preserves Co.
v. Norris, 43 Fed. Rep. 711; Electric Co. v. Jamaica Co., 61
Fed. Rep. 655, 678.
Any effort to limit the right to sell necessarily would deprive
these defendants of their property without due process of law.

v. Gillson, 109 N. Y. 389; Forster v. Scott, 136 N. Y. 577; Inger-
soll v. Nassau Co., 157 N. Y. 453, 463; Purdy v. Erie R. R. Co.,

ple v. Meyer, 44 App. Div. (N. Y.) 1; Ingraham v. National Salt
Co., 72 App. Div. (N. Y.) 582; Janesville v. Carpenter, 77 Wis-
consin, 288, 301.
If complainant's contention should be sustained, the right
of an owner of property to sell the same would be dependent
upon what the courts at any future time might hold to be the
intention of the purchaser in buying the property. Such a
result would seriously impair the liberty of the owner, and the
value of his property.
Whatever view be taken of the character of the transaction
the decree of the Circuit Court transcended the authority of
the court under the statute, which was the sole ground and
source of its jurisdiction.

Day, Assistant to the Attorney General, was on the brief, for
the United States, appellee:

of the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 209; the de-
fendant, Northern Securities Company, is a corporation organ-
ized under the general laws of New Jersey; the two railway
companies are common carriers engaged in freight and passen-
ger traffic among the several States and with foreign nations;
the Great Northern was chartered by the State of Minnesota
and the Northern Pacific Railway Company operates under a
Federal franchise originally granted to the Northern Pacific
Railroad Company, and in taking over that franchise it not
only became invested with the rights and privileges incident
thereto, but also became charged with the duties, obligations
and conditions which Congress attached to the granting thereof.
The Northern Pacific Railroad Company was the constant
concern of Congress. See Act of July 2, 1864, Res. May 7,
1866, extending time for completion; Act of June 25, 1868, rel-
ative to filing reports; Joint Resolution, July 1, 1868, extend-
ing time for completion; Joint resolution of March 1, 1869,
allowing issue of bonds; Joint Resolution, April 10, 1869,
granting right of way; Resolution of May 31, 1870, author-
izing issue of bonds; act of September 29, 1890, forfeitig
certain granted lands; act of February 26, 1895, providing
for classification of mineral lands; act of July 1, 1898, granting
lands in lieu of those taken by settlers.
The individual defendants were, prior to November 13, 1901,
large and influential holders of the stock, some of one railway
company and some of both companies. The two railroads
are practically parallel for their entire length; each system
runs east and west through Minnesota, North Dakota, Mon-
tana, Idaho and Washington; each connects with steamers on
Lake Superior running to Buffalo and other eastern points and
at Seattle with lines of the steamships engaged in trade with
the Orient. The lower court found that the roads "are, and
in public estimation have ever been regarded as, parallel and
competing." The testimony in this case establishes that fact
which is also res judicata, Pearsall v. Great Northern Raihray
Co., 161 U. S. 646, and even if the roads only competed for
