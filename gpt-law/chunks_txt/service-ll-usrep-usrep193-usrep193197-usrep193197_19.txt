firm acted on its own account and in behalf of no other person
whomsoever, and was actuated by no motive save those above
stated.
The said purchases were not made with intent to violate the
statute or common law of any State or of the United States, and
were not in violation of any such law.
XVII. For some years the defendant Hill and others who
were interested in the Great Northern Company, but not in-
cluding these defendants, had in contemplation the formation of
a corporation for the purpose of purchasing their separate inter-
ests in that company, with the general object that said interests
should be held together and the policy and course of business of
the Great Northern Company should be continuous in develop-
ing the company's system and the territory served by it, and
not subject to radical change and possible inconsistency from
time to time. In or about August, 1901, as this plan was ap-
proaching maturity, said parties for similar reasons determined
that they would also sell to the new company, when formed,
their interests in the Northern Pacific Company, which were
considerable in amount, and that the capital of the new com-
pany should be made sufficiently large to enable it to purchase
all shares of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific com-
panies which the holders might desire to sell and any other
shares which the new company might deem it advisable to
acquire.
By this time it had become known that the purchases in the
market of shares of the Northern Pacific Company, to which
reference is made above, had been made in behalf of a corpora-
tion known as the Oregon Short Line Railroad Company, con-
trolled by the Union Pacific Railroad Company; that there
were held in that interest shares of the Northern Pacific Com-
pany to about the amount of $41,000,000 of preferred stock,
which, however, was to be retired on January 1, 1902, and
$37,000,000 of common stock, together making 780,000 shares
and constituting an absolute majority of the total capital stock
of the Northern Pacific Company. Thereupon and therefore,

with the view and for the purpose of protecting the Northern
Pacific Company and the holders of its common stock against
the possible control of the direction of said company in an ad-
verse interest, these defendants determined and also advised
their friends to sell their Northern Pacific stock to the new
company.
As set forth in the petition, the Northern Securities Com-
pany was duly organized pursuant to the laws of New Jersey
upon November 13, 1901. It was organized according to law,
and possesses all the powers set forth in its certificate of incor-
poration, and has full power to do every act which it has in fact
done, and the petition does not allege the contrary.
It having become known that the Oregon Short Line Com-
pany was not disinclined upon satisfactory terms to sell its
holdings of the major part of the Northern Pacific stock, the
firm of J. P. Morgan & Company, deeming such action for tlhe
best interest of the Northern Pacific Company, purchased from
said Oregon Short Line Company all its holdings of the capital
stock of the Northern Pacific Company.
After its organization the Northern Securities Company duly
purchased all the shares of the Northern Pacific Coml)any anid
of the Great Northern Company hereinbefore mentioned, in-
cluding those purchased by the firm of J. P. Morgan & Com-
pany from the Oregon Short Line Company, for which it paid
partly in cash and partly in its own shares. It also was willing
to purchase the shares of any other shareholders of the Great
Northern Company, who desired to sell the same, for the price
of one hundred and eighty dollars for each share of the Great.
Northern Company, payable in its own shares, and did actually
purchase and pay for considerable amounts of said stock at such(
price.
None of these purchases by the Northern Securities Company
were made with intent to violate the statute or common law of
any State or of the United States, or were in violation of any
such law.
XVIII. The foregoing is a correct statement of all the mat-

ters mentioned in the petition, omitting its many irrelevant
adjectives, adverbs, and conclusions, and of some other facts in
addition thereto. The transactions prior to the formation of
the Northern Securities Company had no connection whatever
with the formation thereof, save as above stated. That com-
pany was organized, not for the purpose of acquiring a majority
of the stock of either the Great Northern or the Northern Pa-
cific Company, but as above set forth. It was not organized
for the purpose of affecting railway rates or competition in the
slightest degree, and has not had any such effect. In the trans-
actions above stated these defendants and, so far as they are
aware, the other parties who have been engaged therein have
never sought or intended to violate the act of Congress of July 2,
1890, entitled "An act to protect trade and commerce against
unlawful restraints and monopolies" (26 Stat. 209, c. 647), or
to enter into any contract, combination in the form of trust or
otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce
among the several States or with foreign nations, or to mo-
nopolize or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with
any other person or persons to monopolize, any part of the trade
or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations.
The transactions have consisted merely in the organization of
a lawful corporation of New Jersey and the sale to and pur-
chase by it of property lawfully salable. All acts done in
relation to the organization of the Securities Company and the
purchase by it of shares of stock of the railway companies and
the sale thereof by the owners have been expressly authorized
by law. They have had no effect whatever, in law or in fact,
in restraint or monopoly of trade or commerce among the sev-
eral States or with foreign nations. The petition does not allege
that at any place within the jurisdiction of this court or else-
where any such restraint or monopoly has been effected.
If these lawful transactions, consisting merely of the pur-
chase and sale of property, should hereafter have any effect in
restraint or monopoly of trade or commerce among the several
States or with foreign nations, such effect would not be their
