an agreement for lowering rates of transportation among the
parties thereto, and it was entered into for the purpose of
driving. out of trade rival steamships in order that thereafter
the rates might be advanced. The English courts held that
the agreement was not a conspiracy, and that it was valid,
although the result aimed at was to drive a rival out of the
field, because so long as the injury to such rival was not the
sole reason for the agreement, but self-interest the predomi-
nating motive, there was nothing wrong in law with an agree-
ment of that kind. But assuming that agreements of this
nature are not void at common law and that the various cases
cited by the learned courts below show it, the answer to the
statement of their validity now is to be found in the terms of
the statute under consideration. The provisions of the Inter-
state Commerce Act relating to reasonable rates, discrimina-
tions, etc., do not authorize such an agreement as this, nor do
they authorize any other agreements which would be incon-
sistent with the provisions of this act.
The general reasons for holding agreements of this nature
to be invalid even at common law, on the part of railroad
companies are quite strong, if not entirely conclusive.
Considering the public character of such corporations, the
privileges and franchises which they have received from the
public in order that they might transact business, and bearing
in mind how closely and immediately the question of rates
for transportation affects the whole public, it may be urged
that Congress had in mind all the difficulties which we have
before suggested of proving the unreasonableness of the rate,
and might, in consideration of all the circumstances, have
deliberately decided to prohibit all agreements and combina-
tions in restraint of trade or commerce, regardless of the ques-
tion whether such agreements were reasonable or the reverse.
It is true that, as to a majority of those living along its line,
each railroad is a monopoly. Upon the subject now under
consideration it is well said by Judge Oliver P. Shiras, United
States District Judge, Northern District of Iowa, in his very
able dissenting opinion in this case in the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals, as follows:

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.
"As to the majority of the community living along its line,
each railway company has a monopoly of the business de-
manding transportation as one of its elements. By reason of
this fact the action of this corporation in establishing the rates
to be charged largely influences the net profit coming to the
farmer, the manufacturer and the merchant, from the sale of
the products of the farm, the workshop and manufactory, and
of the merchandise purchased and resold, and also largely
influences the price to be paid by every one who consumes any
of the property transported over the line of railway. There
is no other line of business carried on in our midst which is
so intimately connected with the public as that conducted by
the railways of the country. . . A railway corporation
engaged in the transportation of the persons and property of
the community is always carrying on a public business which
at all times directly affects the public welfare. All contracts
or combinations entered into between railway corporations
intended to regulate the rates to be charged the public for
the service rendered, must of necessity affect the public
interests. ' By reason of this marked distinction existing be-
tween enterprises inherently public in their character and
those of a private nature, and further by reason of the differ-
ence between private persons and corporations'engaged in
private. pursuits, who owe no direct or primary duty to the
public and public corporations cread for the express purpose
of carrying on public enterprises, and which, in consideration
of the public powers exercised in their behalf, are under obliga-
tion to carry on the work intrusted to their management pri-
marily in the interest and for the benefit of. the community,
it seems clear to me that the same test is not applicable to
both classes of business and corporations in determining the
validity of contracts and combinations entered into by those
engaged therein. . . . In the opinion of the court are
found citations from the reports of the Interstate Commerce
Commission in which are depicted the evils that are occasioned
to the railway companies and the public by warfares over rate
charges, and the advantages that are gained in many directions
by proper conference and concert of action among the com-

peting lines. It may be entirely true that as we proceed in
the development of the policy of public control over railway
traffic, methods will be devised and put in operation by legis-
lative enactment whereby railway companies and the public
may be protected against the evils arising from unrestricted
competition and from rate wars which unsettle the business of
the community, but I fail to perceive the force of the argument
that because railway companies through their own action cause
evils to themselves and the public by sudden changes or re-
ductions in tariff rates they must be permitted to deprive
the community of the benefit of competition in securing
reasonable rates for the transportation of the products of the
country. Competition, free and unrestricted, is the general
rule which governs all the ordinary business pursuits and
transactions of life. Evils, as well as benefits, result there-
from. In the fierce heat of competition the stronger corn-
petitor may crush out the weaker; fluctuations in prices may
be caused that result in wreck and ,disaster; yet, balancing
the benefits as against the evils, the law of competition re-
mains as a controlling element in the business world. That
free and unrestricted competition in the matter of railroad
charges may be productive of evils does not militate against
the fact that such is the law now governing the subject. No
law can be enacted nor system be devised for the control of
human affairs that in its enforcement does not produce some
evil results, no matter how beneficial its general purpose may
be. There are benefits and there are evils which result from
the operation of the law of free competition between railway
companies. The time may come when the companies will be
relieved from the operation of this law, but they cannot, by
combination and agreements among themselves, bring about
this change. The fact that the provisions of the Interstate
Commerce Act may have changed in many respects the con-
duct of the companies in the carrying on of the public business
they are engaged in does not show that it was the intent of
Congress, in the enactment of that statute, to clothe railway
companies with the right to combine together for the purpose
of avoiding the effects of competition on the subject of rates."
