This rule had been long applied by the several States when dealing with combinations that were in restraint of their domestic commerce, and Congress shared the general apprehension that a few powerful corporations or combinations sought to obtain, and, unless restrained, would obtain such absolute control of the entire trade and commerce of the country as would be detrimental to the general welfare.

The Court reasoned that to prevent competition is in itself to violate the law, and that better the chance to violate one law than the certainty of violating another. The agreement was found to vest in the association, through the managers, with appeal to the board of control, the authority to change rates, which was more coercive than that conferred by the Trans-Missouri agreement. The Court also held that the public was not entitled to an arbitrary share of the through traffic and earnings, and that the provisions of the Interstate Commerce law preventing discrimination and undue preferences could be enforced without suppressing competition.

The Anti-Trust Act condemns in express terms every \"combination in the form of trust,\" and if those companies had been combined \"in the form of trust,\" a violation of the very letter of the statute had been proved. The Attorney General also argued that even if the companies had not been combined in the form of a trust, a violation of the Anti-Trust Act would still have been established if it was shown that Mr. Hill, Mr. Morgan, and the other individual defendants had caused the title to a majority of the shares of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific companies to be vested in a single person, thereby centering the control of the two roads in a single head and in that way effecting a combination of them.
