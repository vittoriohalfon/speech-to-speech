FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v. TICOR TITLE
INSURANCE CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 91-72. Argued January 13, 1992-Decided June 12, 1992
Petitioner Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint
charging respondent title insurance companies with horizontal price
fixing in setting fees for title searches and examinations in violation of
ยง 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. In each of the four
States at issue-Connecticut, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Montana-uni-
form rates were established by a rating bureau licensed by the State
and authorized to establish joint rates for its members. Rate filings
were made to the state insurance office and became effective unless the
State rejected them within a specified period. The Administrative Law
Judge held, inter alia, that the rates had been fixed in all four States,
but that, in Wisconsin and Montana, respondents' anticompetitive activi-
ties were entitled to state-action immunity, as contemplated in Parker
v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, and its progeny. Under this doctrine, a state
law or regulatory scheme can be the basis for antitrust immunity if
the State (1) has articulated a clear and affirmative policy to allow the
anticompetitive conduct and (2) provides active supervision of anti-
competitive conduct undertaken by private actors. California Retail
Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, 105. The
Commission, which conceded that the first part of the test was met, held
on review that none of the States had conducted sufficient supervi-
sion to warrant immunity. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that
the existence of a state regulatory program, if staffed, funded, and em-
powered by law, satisfied the active supervision requirement. Thus, it
concluded, respondents' conduct in all the States was entitled to state-
action immunity.
Held:
1. State-action immunity is not available under the regulatory
schemes in Montana and Wisconsin. Pp. 632-640.
(a) Principles of federalism require that federal antitrust laws be
subject to supersession by state regulatory programs. Parker,s upra,
at 350-352; Midcal, supra; Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94. Midcal's
two-part test confirms that States may not confer antitrust immunity
on private persons by fiat. Actual state involvement is the precondition
for immunity, which is conferred out of respect for the State's ongoing

regulation, not the economics of price restraint. The purpose of the
active supervision inquiry is to determine whether the State has exer-
cised sufficient independent judgment and control so that the details of
the rates or prices have been established as a product of deliberate
state intervention. Although this immunity doctrine was developed in
actions brought under the Sherman Act, the issue whether it applies to
Commission action under the Federal Trade Commission Act need not
be determined, since the Commission does not assert any superior pre-
emption authority here. Pp. 632-635.
(b) Wisconsin, Montana, and 34 other States correctly contend
that a broad interpretation of state-action immunity would not serve
their best interests. The doctrine would impede, rather than advance,
the States' freedom of action if it required them to act in the shadow of
such immunity whenever they entered the realm of economic regulation.
Insistence on real compliance with both parts of the Midcal test serves
to make clear that the States are responsible for only the price fixing
they have sanctioned and undertaken to control. Respondents' conten-
tion that such concerns are better addressed by the first part of the
Midcal test misapprehends the close relation between Midcal's two
elements, which are both directed at ensuring that particular anticom-
petitive mechanisms operate because of a deliberate and intended state
policy. A clear policy statement ensures only that the State did not act
through inadvertence, not that the State approved the anticompetitive
conduct. Sole reliance on the clear articulation requirement would not
allow the States sufficient regulatory flexibility. Pp. 635-637.
(c) Where prices or rates are initially set by private parties, subject
to veto only if the State chooses, the party claiming the immunity must
show that state officials have undertaken the necessary steps to deter-
mine the specifics of the price-fixing or ratesetting scheme. The mere
potential for state supervision is not an adequate substitute for the
State's decision. Thus, the standard relied on by the Court of Appeals
in this case is insufficient to establish the requisite level of active super-
vision. The Commission's findings of fact demonstrate that the poten-
tial for state supervision was not realized in either Wisconsin or Mon-
tana. While most rate filings were checked for mathematical accuracy,
some were unchecked altogether. Moreover, one rate filing became
effective in Montana despite the rating bureau's failure to provide re-
quested information, and additional information was provided in Wis-
consin after seven years, during which time another rate filing remained
in effect. Absent active supervision, there can be no state-action im-
munity for what were otherwise private price-fixing arrangements.
And state judicial review cannot fill the void. See Patrick, supra, at
103-105. This Court's decision in Southern Motor CarriersR ate Con-

ference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U. S. 48, which involved a similar
negative option regime, is not to the contrary, since it involved the ques-
tion whether the first part of the Midcal test was met. This case in-
volves horizontal price fixing under a vague imprimatur in form and
agency inaction in fact, and it should be read in light of the gravity of
the antitrust offense, the involvement of private actors throughout, and
the clear absence of state supervision. Pp. 637-640.
2. The Court of Appeals should have the opportunity to reexamine
its determinations with respect to Connecticut and Arizona in order to
address whether it accorded proper deference to the Commission's fac-
tual findings as to the extent of state supervision in those States. P. 640.

Opinion of the Court
companies, alleging horizontal price fixing in their fees for
title searches and title examinations. One company settled
by consent decree, while five other firms continue to contest
the matter. The Commission charged the title companies
with violating ยง 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act,
38 Stat. 719, 15 U. S. C. ยง45(a)(1), which prohibits "[u]nfair
methods of competition in or affecting commerce." One of
the principal defenses the companies assert is state-action
immunity from antitrust prosecution, as contemplated in the
line of cases beginning with Parkerv . Brown, 317 U. S. 341
(1943). The Commission rejected this defense, In re Ticor
Title Ins. Co., 112 F. T. C. 344 (1989), and the firms sought
review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit. Ruling that state-action immunity was available
under the state regulatory schemes in question, the Court
of Appeals reversed. 922 F. 2d 1122 (1991). We granted
certiorari. 502 U. S. 806 (1991).

Title insurance is the business of insuring the record title
of real property for persons with some interest in the estate,
including owners, occupiers, and lenders. A title insurance
policy insures against certain losses or damages sustained by
reason of a defect in title not shown on the policy or title
report to which it refers. Before issuing a title insurance

policy, the insurance company or one of its agents performs
a title search and examination. The search produces a
chronological list of the public documents in the chain of title
to the real property. The examination is a critical analysis
or interpretation of the condition of title revealed by the doc-
uments disclosed through this search.
The title search and examination are major components of
the insurance company's services. There are certain vari-
ances from State to State and from policy to policy, but a
brief summary of the functions performed by the title compa-
nies can be given. The insurance companies exclude from
coverage defects uncovered during the search; that is, the
insurers conduct searches in order to inform the insured and
to reduce their own liability by identifying and excluding
known risks. The insured is protected from some losses re-
sulting from title defects not discoverable from a search of
the public records, such as forgery, missing heirs, previous
marriages, impersonation, or confusion in names. They are
protected also against errors or mistakes in the search and
examination. Negligence need not be proved in order to re-
cover. Title insurance also includes the obligation to defend
in the event that an insured is sued by reason of some defect
within the scope of the policy's guarantee.
The title insurance industry earned $1.35 billion in gross
revenues in 1982, and respondents accounted for 57 percent
of that amount. Four of respondents are the nation's largest
title insurance companies: Ticor Title Insurance Co., with
16.5 percent of the market; Chicago Title Insurance Co., with
12.8 percent; Lawyers Title Insurance Co., with 12 percent;
and SAFECO Title Insurance Co. (now operating under the
name Security Union Title Insurance Co.), with 10.3 percent.
Stewart Title Guarantee Co., with 5.4 percent of the market,
is the country's eighth largest title insurer, with a strong
position in the West and Southwest. App. to Pet. for Cert.

Opinion of the Court
The Commission issued an administrative complaint in
1985. Horizontal price fixing was alleged in these terms:
"'Respondents have agreed on the prices to be charged
for title search and examination services or settlement
services through rating bureaus in various states. Ex-
amples of states in which one or more of the respond-
ents have fixed prices with other respondents or other
competitors for all or part of their search and examina-
tion services or settlement services are Arizona, Con-
necticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, New Jersey, New
Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Wiscon-
sin and Wyoming."' 112 F. T. C., at 346.
The Commission did not challenge the insurers' practice of
setting uniform rates for insurance against the risk of loss
from defective titles, but only the practice of setting uniform
rates for the title search, examination, and settlement, as-
pects of the business which, the Commission alleges, do not
involve insurance.
Before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), respondents
defended against liability on three related grounds. First,
they maintained that the challenged conduct is exempt
from antitrust scrutiny under the McCarran-Ferguson Act,
59 Stat. 34, 15 U. S. C. ยง 1012(b), which confers antitrust
immunity over the "business of insurance" to the extent reg-
ulated by state law. Second, they argued that their collec-
tive ratemaking activities are exempt under the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine, which places certain "[j]oint efforts to
influence public officials" beyond the reach of the antitrust
laws. Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U. S. 657, 670
(1965); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr
Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127, 136 (1961). Third, re-
spondents contended their activities are entitled to state-
action immunity, which permits anticompetitive conduct if
authorized and supervised by state officials. See California
Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445

to Pet. for Cert. 218a. As to one State, Ohio, respondents
contended that the rates for title search, examination, and
settlement had not been set by a rating bureau.
Title insurance company rates and practices in 13 States
were the subject of the initial complaint. Before the matter
was decided by the ALJ, the Commission declined to pursue
its complaint with regard to fees in five of these States:
Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Wyoming.
Upon the recommendation of the ALJ, the Commission did
not pursue its complaint with regard to fees in two additional
States, Idaho and Ohio. This left six States in which the
Commission found antitrust violations, but in two of these
States, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the Commission con-
ceded the issue on which certiorari was sought here, so the
regulatory regimes in these two States are not before us.
Four States remain in which violations were alleged: Con-
necticut, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Montana.
The ALJ held that the rates for search and examination
services had been fixed in these four States. For reasons we
need not pause to examine, the ALJ rejected the McCarran-
Ferguson and Noerr-Pennington defenses. The ALJ then
turned his attention to the question of state-action immunity.
A summary of the ALJ's extensive findings on this point is
necessary for a full understanding of the decisions reached
at each level of the proceedings in the case.
Rating bureaus are private entities organized by title in-
surance companies to establish uniform rates for their mem-
bers. The ALJ found no evidence that the collective setting
of title insurance rates through rating bureaus is a way of
pooling risk information. Indeed, he found no evidence that
any title insurer sets rates according to actuarial loss experi-
ence. Instead, the ALJ found that the usual practice is for
rating bureaus to set rates according to profitability studies
that focus on the costs of conducting searches and examina-
tions. Uniform rates are set notwithstanding differences in

Opinion of the Court
efficiencies and costs among individual members. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 183a-184a.
The ALJ described the regulatory regimes for title insur-
ance rates in the four States still at issue. In each one, the
title insurance rating bureau was licensed by the State and
authorized to establish joint rates for its members. Each of
the four States used what has come to be called a "negative
option" system to approve rate filings by the bureaus.
Under a negative option system, the rating bureau filed rates
for title searches and title examinations with the state insur-
ance office. The rates became effective unless the State
rejected them within a specified period, such as 30 days. Al-
though the negative option system provided a theoretical
mechanism for substantive review, the ALJ determined,
after making detailed findings regarding the operation of
each regulatory regime, that the rate filings were subject to
minimal scrutiny by state regulators.
In Connecticut the State Insurance Department has the
authority to audit the rating bureau and hold hearings re-
garding rates, but it has not done so. The Connecticut rat-
ing bureau filed only two major rate increases, in 1966 and
in 1981. The circumstances behind the 1966 rate increase
are somewhat obscure. The ALJ found that the Insurance
Department asked the rating bureau to submit additional in-
formation justifying the increase, and later approved the
rate increase although there is no evidence the additional
information was provided. In 1981 the Connecticut rating
bureau filed for a 20 percent rate increase. The factual
background for this rate increase is better developed though
the testimony was somewhat inconsistent. A state insur-
ance official testified that he reviewed the rate increase with
care and discussed various components of the increase with
the rating bureau. The same official testified, however, that
he lacked the authority to question certain expense data he
considered quite high. Id., at 189a-195a.

NEW PAGE

FTC v. TICOR TITLE INS. CO.
Opinion of the Court
In Wisconsin the State Insurance Commissioner is re-
quired to examine the rating bureau at regular intervals and
authorized to reject rates through a process of hearings.
Neither has been done. The Wisconsin rating bureau made
major rate filings in 1971, 1981, and 1982. The 1971 rate
filing was approved in 1971 although supporting justification,
which had been requested by the State Insurance Commis-
sioner, was not provided until 1978. The 1981 rate filing
requested an 11 percent rate increase. The increase was
approved after the office of the Insurance Commissioner
checked the supporting data for accuracy. No one in the
agency inquired into insurer expenses, though an official
testified that substantive scrutiny would not be possible
without that inquiry. The 1982 rate increase received but a
cursory reading at the office of the Insurance Commissioner.
The supporting materials were not checked for accuracy,
though in the absence of an objection by the agency, the rate
increase went into effect. Id., at 196a-200a.
In Arizona the Insurance Director was required to exam-
ine the rating bureau at least once every five years. It was
not done. In 1980 the State Insurance Department an-
nounced a comprehensive investigation of the rating bureau.
It was not conducted. The rating bureau spent most of its
time justifying its escrow rates. Following conclusion in
1981 of a federal civil suit challenging the joint fixing of es-
crow rates, the rating bureau went out of business without
having made any major rate filings, though it had proposed
minor rate adjustments. Id., at 200a-205a.
In Montana the rating bureau made its only major rate
filing in 1983. In connection with it, a representative of the
rating bureau met with officials of the State Insurance De-
partment. He was told that the filed rates could go into
immediate effect though further profit data would have to be
provided. The ALJ found no evidence that the additional
data were furnished. Id., at 211a-214a.

NEW PAGE

Opinion of the Court
To complete the background, the ALJ observed that none
of the rating bureaus are now active. The respondents
abandoned them between 1981 and 1985 in response to nu-
merous private treble-damages suits, so by the time the
Commission filed its formal complaint in 1985, the rating bu-
reaus had been dismantled. Id., at 195a, 200a, 205a, 208a.
The ALJ held that the case is not moot, though, because
nothing would preclude respondents from resuming the
conduct challenged by the Commission. Id., at 246a-247a.
See United States v. W. T Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 632-633
(1953).
These factual determinations established, the ALJ ad-
dressed the two-part test that must be satisfied for state-
action immunity under the antitrust laws, the test we set out
in CaliforniaR etail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Alumi-
num, Inc., 445 U. S. 97 (1980). A state law or regulatory
scheme cannot be the basis for antitrust immunity unless,
first, the State has articulated a clear and affirmative policy
to allow the anticompetitive conduct, and second, the State
provides active supervision of anticompetitive conduct un-
dertaken by private actors. Id., at 105. The Commission
having conceded that the first part of the test was satisfied
in the four States still at issue, the immunity question, begin-
ning with the hearings before the ALJ and in all later pro-
ceedings, has turned upon the proper interpretation and
application of Midcal's active supervision requirement. The
ALJ found the active supervision test was met in Arizona
and Montana but not in Connecticut or Wisconsin. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 248a.
On review of the ALJ's decision, the Commission held that
none of the four States had conducted sufficient supervision,
so that the title companies were not entitled to immunity in
any of those jurisdictions. Id., at 47a. The Court of Ap-
peals for the Third Circuit disagreed with the Commission,
adopting the approach of the First Circuit in New England
Motor Rate Bureau, Inc. v. FTC, 908 F. 2d 1064 (1990), which

NEW PAGE

FTC v. TICOR TITLE INS. CO.
Opinion of the Court
had held that the existence of a state regulatory program, if
staffed, funded, and empowered by law, satisfied the require-
ment of active supervision. Id., at 1071. Under this stand-
ard, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that
the active state supervision requirement was met in all four
States and held that the respondents' conduct was entitled
to state-action immunity in each of them. 922 F. 2d, at 1140.
We granted certiorari to consider two questions: First,
whether the Third Circuit was correct in its statement of the
law and in its application of law to fact, and second, whether
the Third Circuit exceeded its authority by departing from
the factual findings entered by the ALJ and adopted by the
Commission. Before this Court, the parties have confined
their briefing on the first of these questions to the regulatory
regimes of Wisconsin and Montana, and focused on the regu-
latory regimes of Connecticut and Arizona in briefing on the
second question. We now reverse the Court of Appeals
under the first question and remand for further proceedings
under the second.
II
The preservation of the free market and of a system of
free enterprise without price fixing or cartels is essential to
economic freedom. United States v. Topco Associates, Inc.,
405 U. S. 596, 610 (1972). A national policy of such a perva-
sive and fundamental character is an essential part of the
economic and legal system within which the separate States
administer their own laws for the protection and advance-
ment of their people. Continued enforcement of the national
antitrust policy grants the States more freedom, not less, in
deciding whether to subject discrete parts of the economy
to additional regulations and controls. Against this back-
ground, in Parkerv . Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943), we upheld
a state-supervised, market sharing scheme against a Sher-
man Act challenge. We announced the doctrine that federal
antitrust laws are subject to supersession by state regula-

Opinion of the Court
tory programs. Our decision was grounded in principles of
federalism. Id., at 350-352.
The principle of freedom of action for the States, adopted
to foster and preserve the federal system, explains the later
evolution and application of the Parkerd octrine in our deci-
sions in Midcal, supra, and Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94
(1988). In Midcal we invalidated a California statute for-
bidding licensees in the wine trade to sell below prices set
by the producer. There we announced the two-part test ap-
plicable to instances where private parties participate in a
price-fixing regime. "First, the challenged restraint must
be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as
state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised
by the State itself." 445 U. S., at 105 (internal quotation
marks omitted). Midcal confirms that while a State may
not confer antitrust immunity on private persons by fiat, it
may displace competition with active state supervision if the
displacement is both intended by the State and implemented
in its specific details. Actual state involvement, not defer-
ence to private price-fixing arrangements under the general
auspices of state law, is the precondition for immunity from
federal law. Immunity is conferred out of respect for on-
going regulation by the State, not out of respect for the
economics of price restraint. In Midcal we found that the
intent to restrain prices was expressed with sufficient preci-
sion so that the first part of the test was met, but that the
absence of state participation in the mechanics of the price
posting was so apparent that the requirement of active su-
pervision had not been met. Ibid.
The rationale was further elaborated in Patrick v. Burget.
In Patrick it had been alleged that private physicians partic-
ipated in the State's peer review system in order to injure
or destroy competition by denying hospital privileges to a
physician who had begun a competing clinic. We referred
to the purpose of preserving the State's own administrative

Opinion of the Court
policies, as distinct from allowing private parties to foreclose
competition, in the following passage:
"The active supervision requirement stems from the rec-
ognition that where a private party is engaging in the
anticompetitive activity, there is a real danger that he
is acting to further his own interests, rather than the
governmental interests of the State. . . . The require-
ment is designed to ensure that the state-action doctrine
will shelter only the particular anticompetitive acts of
private parties that, in the judgment of the State, actu-
ally further state regulatory policies. To accomplish
this purpose, the active supervision requirement man-
dates that the State exercise ultimate control over the
challenged anticompetitive conduct .... The mere pres-
ence of some state involvement or monitoring does not
suffice.... The active supervision prong of the Midcal
test requires that state officials have and exercise power
to review particular anticompetitive acts of private par-
ties and disapprove those that fail to accord with state
policy. Absent such a program of supervision, there is
no realistic assurance that a private party's anticompeti-
tive conduct promotes state policy, rather than merely
the party's individual interests." 486 U. S., at 100-101
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
Because the particular anticompetitive conduct at issue in
Patrick had not been supervised by governmental actors, we
decided that the actions of the peer review committee were
not entitled to state-action immunity. Id., at 106.
Our decisions make clear that the purpose of the active
supervision inquiry is not to determine whether the State
has met some normative standard, such as efficiency, in its
regulatory practices. Its purpose is to determine whether
the State has exercised sufficient independent judgment and
control so that the details of the rates or prices have been
established as a product of deliberate state intervention, not

Opinion of the Court
simply by agreement among private parties. Much as in
causation inquiries, the analysis asks whether the State has
played a substantial role in determining the specifics of the
economic policy. The question is not how well state regula-
tion works but whether the anticompetitive scheme is the
State's own.
Although the point bears but brief mention, we observe
that our prior cases considered state-action immunity
against actions brought under the Sherman Act, and this
case arises under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The
Commission has argued at other times that state-action im-
munity does not apply to Commission action under ยง 5 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U. S. C. ยง 45. See U. S.
Bureau of Consumer Protection, Staff Report to the Federal
Trade Commission on Prescription Drug Price Disclosures,
Chs. VI(B) and (C) (1975); see also Note, The State Action
Exemption and Antitrust Enforcement under the Federal
Trade Commission Act, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 715 (1976). A lead-
ing treatise has expressed its skepticism of this view. See
1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 218 (1978). We
need not determine whether the antitrust statutes can be
distinguished on this basis, because the Commission does not
assert any superior pre-emption authority in the instant
matter. We apply our prior cases to the one before us.
Respondents contend that principles of federalism justify
a broad interpretation of state-action immunity, but there is
a powerful refutation of their viewpoint in the briefs that
were filed in this case. The State of Wisconsin, joined by
Montana and 34 other States, has filed a brief as amici cu-
riae on the precise point. These States deny that respond-
ents' broad immunity rule would serve the States' best inter-
ests. We are in agreement with the amici submission.
If the States must act in the shadow of state-action immu-
nity whenever they enter the realm of economic regulation,
then our doctrine will impede their freedom of action, not
advance it. The fact of the matter is that the States regu-

late their economies in many ways not inconsistent with the
antitrust laws. For example, Oregon may provide for peer
review by its physicians without approving anticompetitive
conduct by them. See Patrick, 486 U. S., at 105. Or Mich-
igan may regulate its public utilities without authorizing
monopolization in the market for electric light bulbs. See
Cantorv . DetroitE dison Co., 428 U. S. 579,596 (1976). So we
have held that state-action immunity is disfavored, much as
are repeals by implication. Lafayette v. LouisianaP ower &
Light Co., 435 U. S. 389, 398-399 (1978). By adhering in
most cases to fundamental and accepted assumptions about
the benefits of competition within the framework of the anti-
trust laws, we increase the States' regulatory flexibility.
States must accept political responsibility for actions they
intend to undertake. It is quite a different matter, however,
for federal law to compel a result that the States do not in-
tend but for which they are held to account. Federalism
serves to assign political responsibility, not to obscure it.
Neither federalism nor political responsibility is well served
by a rule that essential national policies are displaced by
state regulations intended to achieve more limited ends.
For States which do choose to displace the free market with
regulation, our insistence on real compliance with both parts
of the Midcal test will serve to make clear that the State is
responsible for the price fixing it has sanctioned and under-
taken to control.
Respondents contend that these concerns are better ad-
dressed by the requirement that the States articulate a clear
policy to displace the antitrust laws with their own forms
of economic regulation. This contention misapprehends the
close relation between Midcal's two elements. Both are di-
rected at ensuring that particular anticompetitive mecha-
nisms operate because of a deliberate and intended state pol-
icy. See Patrick,s upra,a t 100. In the usual case, Midcal's
requirement that the State articulate a clear policy shows
little more than that the State has not acted through inad-

Opinion of the Court
vertence; it cannot alone ensure, as required by our prece-
dents, that particular anticompetitive conduct has been ap-
proved by the State. It seems plain, moreover, in light of
the amici curiae brief to which we have referred, that sole
reliance on the requirement of clear articulation will not
allow the regulatory flexibility that these States deem neces-
sary. For States whose object it is to benefit their citizens
through regulation, a broad doctrine of state-action immu-
nity may serve as nothing more than an attractive nuisance
in the economic sphere. To oppose these pressures, sole re-
liance on the requirement of clear articulation could become
a rather meaningless formal constraint.
III
In the case before us, the Court of Appeals relied upon a
formulation of the active supervision requirement articu-
lated by the First Circuit:
"'Where ... the state's program is in place, is staffed
and funded, grants to the state officials ample power and
the duty to regulate pursuant to declared standards of
state policy, is enforceable in the state's courts, and dem-
onstrates some basic level of activity directed towards
seeing that the private actors carry out the state's policy
and not simply their own policy, more need not be estab-
lished."' 922 F. 2d, at 1136, quoting New England
Motor Rate Bureau, Inc. v. FTC, 908 F. 2d, at 1071.
Based on this standard, the Third Circuit ruled that the ac-
tive supervision requirement was met in all four States, and
held that the respondents' conduct was entitled to state-
action immunity from antitrust liability. 922 F. 2d, at 1140.
While in theory the standard articulated by the First Cir-
cuit might be applied in a manner consistent with our prece-
dents, it seems to us insufficient to establish the requisite
level of active supervision. The criteria set forth by the
First Circuit may have some relevance as the beginning

Opinion of the Court
point of the active state supervision inquiry, but the analysis
cannot end there. Where prices or rates are set as an initial
matter by private parties, subject only to a veto if the State
chooses to exercise it, the party claiming the immunity must
show that state officials have undertaken the necessary steps
to determine the specifics of the price-fixing or ratesetting
scheme. The mere potential for state supervision is not
an adequate substitute for a decision by the State. Under
these standards, we must conclude that there was no active
supervision in either Wisconsin or Montana.
Respondents point out that in Wisconsin and Montana the
rating bureaus filed rates with state agencies and that in
both States the so-called negative option rule prevailed.
The rates became effective unless they were rejected within
a set time. It is said that as a matter of law in those States
inaction signified substantive approval. This proposition
cannot be reconciled, however, with the detailed findings, en-
tered by the ALJ and adopted by the Commission, which
demonstrate that the potential for state supervision was not
realized in fact. The ALJ found, and the Commission
agreed, that at most the rate filings were checked for mathe-
matical accuracy. Some were unchecked altogether. In
Montana, a rate filing became effective despite the failure of
the rating bureau to provide additional requested informa-
tion. In Wisconsin, additional information was provided
after a lapse of seven years, during which time the rate filing
remained in effect. These findings are fatal to respondents'
attempts to portray the state regulatory regimes as provid-
ing the necessary component of active supervision. The
findings demonstrate that, whatever the potential for state
regulatory review in Wisconsin and Montana, active state
superYision did not occur. In the absence of active supervi-
sion in fact, there can be no state-action immunity for what
were otherwise private price-fixing arrangements. And as
in Patrick, the availability of state judicial review could not
fill the void. Because of the state agencies' limited role and

participation, state judicial review was likewise limited.
See Patrick, 486 U. S., at 103-105.
Our decision in Southern Motor Carriers Rate Confer-
ence, Inc. v. United States, 471 U. S. 48 (1985), though it too
involved a negative option regime, is not to the contrary.
The question there was whether the first part of the Midcal
test was met, the Government's contention being that a pric-
ing policy is not an articulated one unless the practice is com-
pelled. We rejected that assertion and undertook no real
examination of the active supervision aspect of the case, for
the Government conceded that the second part of the test
had been met. Id., at 62, 66. The concession was against
the background of a District Court determination that, al-
though submitted rates could go into effect without further
state activity, the State had ordered and held ratemaking
hearings on a consistent basis, using the industry submis-
sions as the beginning point. See United States v. Southern
Motor CarriersR ate Conference, Inc., 467 F. Supp. 471, 476-
477 (ND Ga. 1979). In the case before us, of course, the
Commission concedes the first part of the Midcal require-
ment and litigates the second; and there is no finding of sub-
stantial state participation in the ratesetting scheme.
This case involves horizontal price fixing under a vague
imprimatur in form and agency inaction in fact. No anti-
trust offense is more pernicious than price fixing. FTC v.
Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U. S. 411, 434, n. 16
(1990). In this context, we decline to formulate a rule that
would lead to a finding of active state supervision where in
fact there was none. Our decision should be read in light of
the gravity of the antitrust offense, the involvement of pri-
vate actors throughout, and the clear absence of state super-
vision. We do not imply that some particular form of state
or local regulation is required to achieve ends other than
the establishment of uniform prices. Cf. Columbia v. Omni
Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365 (1991) (city billboard
zoning ordinance entitled to state-action immunity). We do

not have before us a case in which governmental actors made
unilateral decisions without participation by private actors.
Cf. Fisher v. Berkeley, 475 U. S. 260 (1986) (private actors
not liable without private action). And we do not here call
into question a regulatory regime in which sampling tech-
niques or a specified rate of return allow state regulators
to provide comprehensive supervision without complete con-
trol, or in which there was an infrequent lapse of state super-
vision. Cf. 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U. S. 335, 344,
n. 6 (1987) (a statute specifying the margin between whole-
sale and retail prices may satisfy the active supervision re-
quirement). In the circumstances of this case, however, we
conclude that the acts of respondents in the States of Mon-
tana and Wisconsin are not immune from antitrust liability.
IV
In granting certiorari we undertook to review the further
contention by the Commission that the Court of Appeals was
incorrect in disregarding the Commission's findings as to the
extent of state supervision. The parties have focused their
briefing on this question on the regulatory schemes of
Connecticut and Arizona. We think the Court of Appeals
should have the opportunity to reexamine its determinations
with respect to these latter two States in light of the views
we have expressed.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring.
The Court's standard is in my view faithful to what our
cases have said about "active supervision." On the other
hand, I think THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE O'CONNOR
are correct that this standard will be a fertile source of un-
certainty and (hence) litigation, and will produce total aban-

donment of some state programs because private individuals
will not take the chance of participating in them. That is
true, moreover, not just in the "negative option" context, but
even in a context such as that involved in Patrick v. Burget,
486 U. S. 94 (1988): Private physicians invited to participate
in a state-supervised hospital peer review system may not
know until after their participation has occurred (and indeed
until after their trial has been completed) whether the
State's supervision will be "active" enough.
I am willing to accept these consequences because I see no
alternative within the constraints of our "active supervision"
doctrine, which has not been challenged here; and because I
am skeptical about the Parkerv . Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943),
exemption for state-programmed private collusion in the
first place.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE O'CON-
NOR and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.
The Court holds today that to satisfy the "active supervi-
sion" requirement of state-action immunity from antitrust
liability, private parties acting pursuant to a regulatory
scheme enacted by a state legislature must prove that "the
State has played a substantial role in determining the spe-
cifics of the economic policy." Ante, at 635. Because this
standard is neither supported by our prior precedent nor
sound as a matter of policy, I dissent.
Immunity from antitrust liability under the state-action
doctrine was first established in Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S.
341 (1943). As noted by the majority, in Parkerw e relied
on principles of federalism in concluding that the Sherman
Act did not apply to state officials administering a regulatory
program enacted by the state legislature. We concluded
that state action is exempt from antitrust liability, because
in the Sherman Act Congress evidences no intent to "re-
strain state action or official action directed by a state." Id.,

intend to compromise the States' ability to regulate their
domestic commerce." Southern Motor CarriersR ate Con-
ference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U. S.4 8, 56 (1985) (foot-
note omitted).
We developed our present analysis for state-action immu-
nity for private actors in CaliforniaR etail Liquor Dealers
Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S.9 7 (1980). We
held in Midcal that our prior precedent had granted state-
action immunity from antitrust liability to conduct by pri-
vate actors where a program was "clearly articulated and
affirmatively expressed as state policy [and] the policy [was]
actively supervised by the State itself." Id., at 105 (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). In Midcal, we found
the active supervision requirement was not met because
under the California statute at issue, which required liquor
retailers to charge a certain percentage above a price
"posted" by area wholesalers, "[t]he State has no direct con-
trol over wine prices, and it does not review the reasonable-
ness of the prices set by wine dealers." Id., at 100. We
noted that the state-action defense does not allow the States
to authorize what is nothing more than private price fixing.
Id., at 105.
In each instance since Midcal in which we have concluded
that the active supervision requirement for state-action im-

trust policy grants the States more freedom, not less, in deciding whether
to subject discrete parts of the economy to additional regulations and con-
trols," ante, at 632. However, in Parker, we held that the Sherman Act
simply does not apply to conduct regulated by the State. The enforce-
ment of the national antitrust policy, as embodied in the antitrust laws,
may grant individuals more freedom to compete in our free market sys-
tem, but it does not implicate the freedom of the States in deciding
whether to regulate.

by the private actors facing antitrust liability.2 Our most
recent formulation of the "active supervision" requirement
was announced in Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94 (1988),
where we concluded that to satisfy the "active supervision"
requirement, "state officials [must] have and exercise power
to review particular anticompetitive acts of private parties
and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy."
Id., at 101. Until today, therefore, we have never had occa-
sion to determine whether a state regulatory program which
gave state officials authority-"power"-to review and regu-
late prices or conduct, might still fail to meet the require-
ment for active state supervision because the State's regula-
tion was not sufficiently detailed or rigorous.
Addressing this question, the Court of Appeals in this case
used the following analysis:
"'Where, as here, the state's program is in place, is
staffed and funded, grants to the state officials ample
power and the duty to regulate pursuant to declared
standards of state policy, is enforceable in the state's
courts, and demonstrates some basic level of activity di-
rected towards seeing that the private actors carry out
the state's policy and not simply their own policy, more
need not be established."' 922 F. 2d 1122, 1136 (CA3
1991), quoting New England Motor Rate Bureau, Inc.
v. FTC, 908 F. 2d 1064, 1071 (CA1 1990).
The Court likens this test to doing away all together with
the active supervision requirement for immunity based on
state action. But the test used by the Court of Appeals is
2I n 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U. S. 335 (1987), we held that a New
York statute failed to shelter private actors from antitrust liability be-
cause the state legislation required retailers to charge 112% of the price
"posted" by wholesalers. The New York statute, like the California stat-
ute at issue in CaliforniaR etail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Alumi-
num, Inc., 445 U. S. 97 (1980), gave no power to the state agency to review
or establish the reasonableness of the price schedules "posted" by the
wholesalers. 324 Liquor, supra,a t 345.

REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting
much more closely attuned to our "have and exercise power"
formulation in Patrick v. Burget than is the rule adopted by
the Court today. The Court simply does not say just how
active a State's regulators must be before the "active super-
vision" requirement will be satisfied. The only guidance it
gives is that the inquiry should be one akin to causation in
a negligence case; does the State play "a substantial role
in determining the specifics of the economic policy." Ante,
at 635. Any other formulation, we are told, will remove
the active supervision requirement altogether as a practical
matter.
I do not believe this to be the case.3 In the States at issue
here, the particular conduct was approved by a state agency.
The agency manifested this approval by raising no objection
to a required rate filing by the entity subject to regulation.
This is quite consistent with our statement that the active
supervision requirement serves mainly an "evidentiary func-
tion" as "one way of ensuring that the actor is engaging in
the challenged conduct pursuant to state policy." Hallie v.
Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34, 46 (1985).
The Court insists that its newly required "active supervi-
sion" will "increase the States' regulatory flexibility." Ante,
at 636. But if private actors who participate, through a
joint rate filing, in a State's "negative option" regulatory
scheme may be liable for treble damages if they cannot prove
that the State approved the specifics of a filing, the Court
makes it highly unlikely that private actors will choose to
participate in such a joint filing. This in turn lessens the
States' regulatory flexibility, because as we have noted be-
fore, joint rate filings can improve the regulatory process
by ensuring that the state agency has fewer filings to con-
sider, allowing more resources to be expended on each filing.
3T he state regulatory programs in Midcal, supra, Patrick v. Burget,
486 U. S. 94 (1988), and 824 Liquor, supra, would all fail to provide immu-
nity for lack of active supervision under the test adopted by the Court
of Appeals.

The Court rejects the test adopted by the Court of Ap-

stead, the party seeking immunity must "show that state
officials have undertaken the necessary steps to determine
the specifics of the price-fixing or ratesetting scheme."
Ante, at 638.5 Such an inquiry necessarily puts the federal
court in the position of determining the efficacy of a particu-
lar State's regulatory scheme, in order to determine whether
the State has met the "requisite level of active supervision."
Ante, at 637. The Court maintains that the proper state-
action inquiry does not determine whether a State has met
some "normative standard" in its regulatory practices.
Ante, at 634. But the Court's focus on the actions taken by
state regulators, i. e., the way the State regulates, necessar-
ily requires a judgment as to whether the State is sufficiently
active-surely a normative judgment.
4 In neither of the examples cited by the majority as instances of state
regulation not intended to authorize anticompetitive conduct would appli-
cation of a less detailed active supervision test change the result. In Pat-
rick v. Burget, supra, we concluded there was no immunity because the
State did not have the authority to review the anticompetitive action un-
dertaken by the peer review committee; in Cantor v. Detroit Edison Ca,
428 U. S. 579 (1976), it is unlikely that the clear articulation requirement
under our current jurisprudence would be met with respect to the market
for light bulbs.
6 It is not clear, from the Court's formulation, whether this is a separate
test applicable only to negative option regulatory schemes, or whether
it applies more generally to issues of immunity under the state-action
doctrine.

FTC v. TICOR TITLE INS. CO.
O'CONNOR, J., dissenting
The Court of Appeals found-properly, in my view-that
while the States at issue here did not regulate respondents'
rates with the vigor petitioner would have liked, the States'
supervision of respondents' conduct was active enough so as
to provide for immunity from antitrust liability. The Court
of Appeals, having concluded that the Federal Trade Com-
mission applied an incorrect legal standard, reviewed the
facts found by the Commission in light of the correct stand-
ard and reached a different conclusion. This does not consti-
tute a rejection of the Commission's factual findings.
I would therefore affirm the judgment below.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
dissenting.
Notwithstanding its assertions to the contrary, the Court
has diminished the States' regulatory flexibility by creating
an impossible situation for those subject to state regulation.
Even when a State has a "clearly articulated policy" author-
izing anticompetitive behavior-which the Federal Trade
Commission concedes was the case here-and even when the
State establishes a system to supervise the implementation
of that policy, the majority holds that a federal court may
later find that the State's supervision was not sufficiently
"substantial" in its "specifics" to insulate the anticompetitive
behavior from antitrust liability. Ante, at 635. Given the
threat of treble damages, regulated entities that have the
option of heeding the State's anticompetitive policy would be
foolhardy to do so; those that are compelled to comply are
less fortunate. The practical effect of today's decision will
likely be to eliminate so-called "negative option" regulation
from the universe of schemes available to a State that seeks
to regulate without exposing certain conduct to federal anti-
trust liability.
The Court does not dispute that each of the States at issue
in this case could have supervised respondents' joint rate-
making; rather, it argues that "the potential for state super-

NEW PAGE

Cite as: 504 U. S. 621 (1992)
O'CONNOR, J., dissenting
vision was not realized in fact." Ante, at 638. Such an
after-the-fact evaluation of a State's exercise of its supervi-
sory powers is extremely unfair to regulated parties. Liabil-
ity under the antitrust laws should not turn on how enthusi-
astically a state official carried out his or her statutory
duties. The regulated entity has no control over the regula-
tor, and very likely will have no idea as to the degree of
scrutiny that its filings may receive. Thus, a party could
engage in exactly the same conduct in two States, each of
which had exactly the same policy of allowing anticompeti-
tive behavior and exactly the same regulatory structure, and
discover afterward that its actions in one State were immune
from antitrust prosecution, but that its actions in the other
resulted in treble-damages liability.
Moreover, even if a regulated entity could assure itself
that the State will undertake to actively supervise its rate
filings, the majority does not offer any guidance as to what
level of supervision will suffice. It declares only that the
State must "pla[y] a substantial role in determining the spe-
cifics of the economic policy." Ante, at 635. That standard
is not only ambiguous, but also runs the risk of being coun-
terproductive. The more reasonable a filed rate, the less
likely that a State will have to play any role other than sim-
ply reviewing the rate for compliance with statutory criteria.
Such a vague and retrospective standard, combined with the
threat of treble damages if that standard is not satisfied,
makes "negative option" regulation an unattractive option
for both States and the parties they regulate.
Finally, it is important to remember that antitrust actions
can be brought by private parties as well as by government
prosecutors. The resources of state regulators are strained
enough without adding the extra burden of asking them to
serve as witnesses in civil litigation and respond to allega-
tions that they did not do their job.
For these reasons, as well as those given by THE CHIEF
JUSTICE, I dissent.
