{"prompt": "Who is at risk of pancreatic cancer?", "completion": "Anyone can get pancreatic cancer, but there are certain risk factors to be aware of. Most pancreatic cancer is diagnosed after age 65. Smoking, diabetes, chronic pancreatitis or inflammation of the pancreas, family history of pancreatic cancer, and certain genetic syndromes are all known risk factors. Carrying extra weight that is unhealthy for your body may also be a contributing factor. New research has found that the specific combination of smoking, diabetes and poor diet increases the risk of pancreatic cancer the most beyond any one factor alone&#8203;``oaicite:{"number":1,"metadata":{"title":"Pancreatic cancer - Symptoms and causes - Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421","text":"Who gets it?\n\nWhile anyone can get pancreatic cancer, there are certain risk factors to be aware of.

{"prompt": "How is pancreatic cancer diagnosed?", "completion": "If your doctors think you may have pancreatic cancer, they may recommend one or more diagnostic tests. For instance, imaging tests like an ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, or PET scan, can help your doctor see a clearer picture of your internal organs. An endoscopic ultrasound, or EUS, is when the doctor passes a tiny camera down the esophagus and into the stomach to get a close-up view of the pancreas. During the EUS, the doctor might collect a biopsy of the tissue for further testing. Sometimes pancreatic cancer can shed specific proteins called tumor markers in your blood. So your doctors may request blood tests to identify elevation of these markers, one of which is called CA 19-9. If a diagnosis is confirmed, the next step is to determine the extent or stage of the cancer. The stages are numbered one through four and may need to be determined by additional testing&#8203;``oaicite:{"number":1,"metadata":{"title":"Pancreatic cancer - Symptoms and causes - Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421","text":"How is it diagnosed?\n\nIf your doctors think you may have pancreatic cancer, they may recommend one or more diagnostic tests.
