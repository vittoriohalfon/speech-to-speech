        "Prompt": "United States v. Freight Association, 305",
        "Response": "Response: This case was heard by the Supreme Court on October Term, 1896. The defendants objected to the hearing of the appeal and asked for it to be dismissed on the ground that the Trans-Missouri Freight Association had been dissolved by a vote of its members since the judgment entered in this suit in the court below. The court decided that the fact of the dissolution of the association did not prevent it from taking cognizance of the appeal and deciding the case upon its merits."
