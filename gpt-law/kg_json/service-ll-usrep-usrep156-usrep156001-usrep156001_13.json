        "Response": "Response: United States v. E. C. Knight Co. was a Supreme Court case decided in October 1894. The case involved a dispute over the power of a combination of corporations to fix prices on refined sugar. Justice Harlan wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the citizens of the several States composing the Union are entitled, of right, to buy goods in the State where they are manufactured, or in any other State, without being confronted by an illegal combination whose business extends throughout the whole country."
