        "Response": "Response: United States v. E. C. Knight Co. is a case from the October Term of 1894 in which the Supreme Court of the United States considered whether a monopoly in the manufacture of a necessary of life could be directly suppressed under the act of Congress. The Court determined that the power to regulate commerce is the power to prescribe the rule by which commerce shall be governed, and is a power independent of the power to suppress monopoly."
