        "Prompt": "In United States v. E. C. Knight Co., what was the dissenting opinion of Harlan, J.?",
        "Response": "Response: In United States v. E. C. Knight Co., Harlan, J. dissented, arguing that the act of Congress of 1890 was not in excess of any power granted to Congress, as it did not strike at the manufacture of articles that are legitimate or recognized subjects of commerce, but at combinations that unduly restrain, because they monopolize, the buying and selling of articles which are to go into interstate commerce. He further argued that Congress has the power to protect the commercial intercourse that such purchasing necessarily involves against the restraints and burdens arising from the existence of combinations that meet purchasers, from whatever State they come, with the threat of not purchasing what they need. The case was decided on October Term, 1894."
