United States is a case from the Supreme Court of the United States, decided on March 14, 1904. The case involved a combination of stockholders of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, who organized a holding corporation, the Northern Securities Company, to hold the shares of the constituent companies. The Supreme Court held that the arrangement was an illegal combination in restraint of interstate commerce and fell within the prohibitions and provisions of the act of July 2, 1890, and it was within the power of the Circuit Court to enjoin the holding company from voting such stock and from exercising any control over the acts and doings of the railroad companies."
