        "Prompt": "In Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. U.S., what did the Commission consider in regards to the anti-competitive contentions advanced by appellants?",
        "Response": "Response: The Commission gave extensive consideration to the anti-competitive contentions advanced by appellants, devoting more than five pages of its report to that matter. It found that \"[a]ll the carriers endeavoring to participate in its control are in competition with Western\"; that the \"important thing is not whether there is possibility of competition, but whether there is probability of existing or potential competition being diminished or strangled by the' Western under the control of the Santa Fe and the Pennsylvania.\" After an extended analysis of the complex facts and conflicting evidence, the Commission found that control of Western by the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania would not result in any significant lessening of competition. The case was decided on October Term, 1959, with the opinion of the Court being 361 U.S."
