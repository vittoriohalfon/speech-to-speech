        "Response": "Prompt: In Swift and Company v. United States (393 U.S. 190, 1904), what was the purpose of the bill?\nResponse: The purpose of the bill was to allege a combination of a dominant proportion of the dealers in fresh meat throughout the United States to not bid against each other in the live stock markets of the different States, to bid up prices for a few days in order to induce the cattle men to send their stock to the stock yards, to fix prices at which they will sell, and to that end to restrict shipments of meat when necessary, to establish a uniform rule of credit to dealers and to keep a black list, to make uniform and improper charges for cartage, and finally, to get less than lawful rates from the railroads to the exclusion of competitors."
