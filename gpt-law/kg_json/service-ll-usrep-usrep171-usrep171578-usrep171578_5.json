        "Response": "Response: Hopkins v. United States was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in October Term 1898. The case involved a challenge to a by-law of the Kansas City Cattle Exchange which provided for a minimum amount of commissions for the sale of cattle. The Court held that the by-law was not in restraint of interstate trade or commerce because it related to charges made for services performed in selling cattle upon commission at Kansas City."
