Northern Securities Co.\nResponse: On October Term, 1903, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Circuit Court could take cognizance of this case upon removal from the state court and make a final decree upon the merits. The court found that the real purpose of the suit was to annul the agreement and suppress the combination between the defendant corporations, which was alleged to be in violation of the laws of Minnesota and the Anti-Trust Act of Congress. The court held that a case arising under the laws of the United States was presented by the allegation in the complaint that the combination and consolidation between the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies and their control of their affairs and operations by the Northern Securities Company were in violation of the Anti-Trust Act of Congress of July 2, 1890."
