Freight Association (1896), what was the dissenting opinion of White, Field, Gray, and Shiras, JJ.?\nResponse: The dissenting opinion of White, Field, Gray, and Shiras, JJ. in United States v. Freight Association (1896) was that the contract in question was valid and should be upheld, as it was reasonable and just and supported by the text of the law. They argued that to annul the contract would be to avoid a contract covered by the law and embodied in its policy, and that it would have a direct tendency to produce the preferences and discriminations which the Interstate Commerce Act was designed to prevent."
