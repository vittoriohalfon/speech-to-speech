        "Response": "Response: Hopkins v. United States was a case argued on February 28 and March 1, 1898 and decided on October 24, 1898. The case involved the Kansas City Live Stock Exchange, an unincorporated volunteer association of men doing business at its stock yards, partly in Kansas City, Missouri, and partly across the line separating Kansas City, Missouri, from Kansas City, Kansas. The purpose of the action was to obtain the dissolution of the exchange and to perpetually enjoin the members from entering into or from continuing in any combination of a like character."
