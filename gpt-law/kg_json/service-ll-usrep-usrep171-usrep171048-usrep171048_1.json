        "Prompt": "Detroit Citizens' Street Railway Company v. Detroit Railway, No. 286, argued April 26, 27, 189 and decided May 23, 1898.",
        "Response": "Response: In this case, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the common council of Detroit had no power, either inherent or derived from the legislature, to confer an exclusive privilege to the Detroit Citizens' Street Railway Company. The court further held that the rights asserted by the company arose from an ordinance of the common council of Detroit passed on November 24, 1862, which provided that the Detroit City Railway was \"exclusively authorized to construct and operate railways as herein provided, on and through\" certain specified streets. The ordinance also provided that the powers and privileges conferred by the ordinance shall be limited to thirty years from and after the date of its passage. The court also noted that sections 33 and 34 of the Tram Railway Act were inserted in the margin."
