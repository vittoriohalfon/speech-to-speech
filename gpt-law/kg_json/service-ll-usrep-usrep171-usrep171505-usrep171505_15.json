        "Prompt": "What is the case of United States v. Joint Traffic Association?",
        "Response": "Response: United States v. Joint Traffic Association is a case from the October Term of 1898. The case involved the legality of a joint agreement between railroads to prevent competition and keep up prices. The Solicitor General argued that competition drives the weak to the wall, the fittest survive, but the greatest good to the greatest number results. The court held that preventing competition and keeping up prices was a restraint of trade and unconstitutional."
