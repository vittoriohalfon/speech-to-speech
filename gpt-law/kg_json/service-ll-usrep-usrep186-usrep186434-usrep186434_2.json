        "Response": "Prompt: Farmers' Loan &c. Co. v. Penn Plate Glass Co.\nResponse: This case was decided by the Supreme Court of the United States on October Term, 1901. The case involved a mortgage agreement between The Farmers' Loan and Trust Company of the State of New York and the Pennsylvania Plate Glass Company. The mortgage agreement provided that the right of action under the indenture was vested exclusively in the trustee, and that the trustee was under no obligation to recognize any person as holder or owner of any bonds secured by the indenture. The mortgaged property was sold at public auction to defendant Kann for the sum of $37,500, and was later conveyed to The Penn Plate Glass Company for a consideration of $83,500. While Kann held the property he paid the interest on the bonds, but default was made in the payment of the coupons maturing on July 1, 1895, and no coupons have been paid since that time."
