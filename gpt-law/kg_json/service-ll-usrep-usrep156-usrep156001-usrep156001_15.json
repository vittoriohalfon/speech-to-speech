        "Prompt": "United States v. E. C. Knight Co.",
        "Response": "Response: This case involved a dispute between the United States and the E. C. Knight Company over the company's alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Harlan argued that the general government had the power to protect the public from monopolies that controlled the prices of goods throughout the country. He argued that the doctrine of the autonomy of the States could not be invoked to deny the power of the national government to protect the public from such dangers. The case was decided on October Term, 1894."
