        "Response": "Prompt: In the case of United States v. Freight Association (1896), what was the opinion of the court regarding agreements among competing railroad companies to keep up reasonable rates?\nResponse: The court recognized the argument that restraint upon the business of railroads will not be prejudicial to the public interest so long as such restraint provides for reasonable rates for transportation and prevents the deadly competition so liable to result in the ruin of the roads and to thereby impair their usefulness to the public. However, it was also noted that the public and those who defend its interests both in and out of Congress deny these results and argue that competition is a necessity for the purpose of securing just and proper rates."
