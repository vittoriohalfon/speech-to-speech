United States, decided in 1898, the Supreme Court held that the formation of a live stock exchange and the adoption of rules preventing members from doing business with non-members did not violate the Federal Statute. The court found that the members of the exchange were engaged in the business of buying and selling cattle on the market, and were competitors among and against each other, and that the organization did not restrain or interfere with interstate or local commerce."
