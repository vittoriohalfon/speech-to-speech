        "Response": "Prompt: In United States v. Joint Traffic Association (1898), what was the opinion of the Court?\nResponse: The Court held that Congress has the power to prohibit, as in restraint of interstate commerce, a contract or combination between competing railroad corporations entered into and formed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining interstate rates and fares for the transportation of freight and passengers on any of the railroads parties to the contract or combination, even though the rates and fares thus established are reasonable. The Court also held that the act does not prohibit any railroad company from charging reasonable rates, and that Congress has the power to forbid any agreement or combination among competing railroad corporations which would extinguish all competition between them and restrain interstate trade or commerce."
