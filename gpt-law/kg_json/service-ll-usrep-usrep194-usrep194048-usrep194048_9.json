The case involved a dispute between the Edward J. Brandt-Dent Company and George W. Beavers, an officer of the government of the United States, over a contract with the government. The Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment was satisfied by one inquiry and adjudication, and an indictment found by the proper grand jury should be accepted anywhere within the United States as at least prima facie evidence of probable cause and sufficient basis for removal from the district where the person arrested is found to the district where the indictment was found. The case number was 194 U.S. and the date of the opinion was April 11, 1904."
