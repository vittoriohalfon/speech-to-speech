        "Response": "Prompt: In Northern Securities Co. v. United States (193 U.S.), what did the Supreme Court hold?\nResponse: The Supreme Court held that to vitiate a combination, such as the act of Congress condemns, it need not be shown that the combination, in fact, results or will result in a total suppression of trade or in a complete monopoly, but it is only essential to show that by its necessary operation it tends to restrain interstate or international trade or commerce or tends to create a monopoly in such trade or commerce and to deprive the public of the advantages that flow from free competition. The Court also held that the constitutional guarantee of liberty of contract does not prevent Congress from prescribing the rule of free competition for those engaged in interstate and international commerce, and that under its power to regulate commerce among the several States and with foreign nations, Congress had authority to enact the statute in question."
