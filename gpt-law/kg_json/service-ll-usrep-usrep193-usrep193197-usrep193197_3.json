        "Response": "Prompt: Northern Securities Co. v. United States (1903)\nResponse: This case involved the attempted consolidation of two parallel and competing transcontinental railway systems, the Northern Pacific system and the Great Northern system. The attempt was defeated by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Pearsall v. The Great Northern Railway Company (decided March 30, 1896). In 1901, the defendants, the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, united in the purchase of the total capital stock of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railway Company, of Illinois, giving the joint bonds of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, payable in twenty years from date, with interest at 4 per cent per annum, for such stock. This purchase secured control of the vast system of railway lines known as the Burlington system, about 8,000 miles in length."
