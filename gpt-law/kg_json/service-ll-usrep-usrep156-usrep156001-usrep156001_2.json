        "Prompt": "United States v. E. C. Knight Co.",
        "Response": "Response: This case involved the sale of refined sugar in the United States and the alleged restraint of trade and commerce in refined sugar among the several States and foreign nations. The bill called for answers under oath and prayed for the delivery up and cancellation of the unlawful agreements, an injunction to prevent further performance of the terms and conditions of the agreements, and an injunction to prevent further violations of the act of Congress approved July 2, 1890. The Circuit Court held that the facts did not show a contract, combination, or conspiracy to restrain or monopolize trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations, and dismissed the bill. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the decree."
