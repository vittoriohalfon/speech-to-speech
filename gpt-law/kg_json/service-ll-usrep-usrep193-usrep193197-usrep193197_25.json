        "Response": "Prompt: Northern Securities Co. v. United States (1903)\nResponse: In this case, the Supreme Court held that the acquisition by a corporation of a controlling interest in the shares of two competing railway companies did not violate the Sherman Act. The Court reasoned that an agreement to do what is legal cannot be an illegal conspiracy, combination or contract, and that the Sherman Act prohibits not a contract tending to restrain trade, but one actually in restraint thereof. The Court also held that the holding by a person or corporation as owner of a majority of the shares of two competing railway companies is not \"a contract or combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade\" within the meaning of the act."
