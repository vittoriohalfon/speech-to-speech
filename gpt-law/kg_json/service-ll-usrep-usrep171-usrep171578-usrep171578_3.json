        "Response": "Response: Hopkins v. United States is a case from the October Term of 1898 in which the plaintiffs sought relief based on the Anti-Trust Act of 1890. The defendants had adopted rules 9 and 16 of the exchange which refused to deal with a member who had violated a rule and been suspended. The Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Kansas granted an injunction restraining the defendants from combining by contract, express or implied, so as to interfere with, hinder or impede others in shipping, trading, selling or buying live stock."
