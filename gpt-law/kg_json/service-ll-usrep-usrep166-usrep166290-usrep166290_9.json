        "Prompt": "What is the opinion of the Court in the United States v. Freight Association case?",
        "Response": "Response: The Court held that the Commerce Act does not authorize an agreement of the nature in question, and that the Trust Act applies to all contracts of the nature described therein, entered into by any one other than competing common carriers by railroad for the purpose of establishing rates of traffic for transportation. The Court also held that the existence of agreements similar to this one may have been known to Congress at the time it passed the Commerce Act, but that its omission to prohibit it at that time is no reason for assuming that when passing the Trust Act it meant to except all contracts of railroad companies in regard to traffic rates from the operation of such act."
