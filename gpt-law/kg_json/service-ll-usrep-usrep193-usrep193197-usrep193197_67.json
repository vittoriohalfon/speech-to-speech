        "Response": "Prompt: Northern Securities Co. v. United States (1903)\nResponse: In this case, the Supreme Court held that the acquisition and ownership of stock does not constitute a direct burden on interstate commerce, as there must be a privity between the manifestation of the power and the resulting burden. The court found that the contract in question did not relate to interstate commerce and did not create a direct burden. The court also stated that Congress does not have the authority to regulate the ownership and possession of property if the enjoyment of such rights would enable those who possess them to engage in interstate commerce."
