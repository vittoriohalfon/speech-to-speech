        "Prompt": "What was the case of Northern Securities Co. v. United States about?",
        "Response": "Response: Northern Securities Co. v. United States was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the acquisition and ownership of stock in state corporations, such as railroad companies, by individuals or corporations was subject to the regulation of Congress under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The Court reasoned that the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce extended to controlling the acquisition and ownership of stock in state corporations, railroad or otherwise, because they may be doing an interstate commerce business. The Court further noted that from the foundation of the government to the time of the adoption of the Anti-Trust Act of 1890, there was an entire absence of any legislation by Congress even suggesting that it was deemed by any one that power was possessed by Congress to control the ownership of stock in railroad or other corporations."
