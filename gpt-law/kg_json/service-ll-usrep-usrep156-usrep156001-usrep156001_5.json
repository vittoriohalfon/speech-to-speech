        "Prompt": "What was the case of United States v. E. C. Knight Co. about?",
        "Response": "Response: United States v. E. C. Knight Co. was a case about the delimitation between the commercial power and the police power, and the risk of resorting to expedients of doubtful constitutionality in order to suppress perceived evils. The Court held that the power of dealing with a monopoly directly may be exercised by the general government whenever interstate or international commerce may be ultimately affected. The Court also held that the intent of the manufacturer does not determine the time when the article or product passes from the control of the State and belongs to commerce. The case was decided on October Term, 1894."
