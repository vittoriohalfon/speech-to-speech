        "Response": "Prompt: Anderson v. United States (1898)\nResponse: In Anderson v. United States (1898), the Supreme Court held that an agreement between persons engaged in the same business for the purpose of properly and reasonably regulating the conduct of their business among themselves and with the public was valid, even if it had the potential to affect interstate trade or commerce indirectly and unintentionally. The Court noted that the agreement did not provide for fixing prices, and that its purpose was not to affect interstate trade or commerce, but rather to provide a standard of business integrity among the members by adopting rules for just and fair dealing."
