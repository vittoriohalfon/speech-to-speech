        "Prompt": "What was the case of United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association?",
        "Response": "Response: United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1898. The case involved a challenge to the constitutionality of the Anti-Trust law as construed by the court. The court held that the Anti-Trust law prohibited every contract in restraint of trade, whether partial, or general, reasonable or unreasonable. The court also held that the government had the right to regulate contracts between carriers and shippers and to place proper restrictions upon contracts among carriers themselves, in order to protect the interests of the public."
