United States is a 1903 Supreme Court case in which the Court held that contracts in restraint of trade are dealt with and defined by the common law, and that combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade are combinations to keep strangers to the agreement out of the business. The Court also held that the prohibition against contracts in restraint of trade applies to contracts between railroads, otherwise remaining independent, by which they restricted their respective freedom as to rates."
