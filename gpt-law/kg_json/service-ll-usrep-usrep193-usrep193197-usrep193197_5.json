The Court found that the Northern Securities Company had acquired a large majority of the capital stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, and a majority or controlling interest in the Great Northern Railway Company, and was voting and collecting dividends on the stock. The Court also found that the Northern Securities Company had been organized solely to incorporate the pooling of the stocks of the two railway companies and to carry out the unlawful combination or conspiracy.
