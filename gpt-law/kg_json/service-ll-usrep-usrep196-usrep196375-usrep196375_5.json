        "Response": "Prompt: In the case of Swift and Company v United States (196 U.S. 387, October Term 1904), what was the argument for the United States?\nResponse: The argument for the United States was that the combination of the defendants to restrain and destroy competition among themselves in the sales of fresh meats to dealers and consumers throughout the United States was a combination in restraint of interstate commerce, and thus fell within the protection of the Federal power over commerce and the Anti Trust Act. The sales of live stock set forth in the petition were either interstate sales proper or sales at their destination and while still in the original state or package, both of which fell within the protection of the Federal power over commerce."
