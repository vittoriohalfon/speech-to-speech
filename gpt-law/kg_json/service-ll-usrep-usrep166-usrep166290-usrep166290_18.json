        "Prompt": "On October Term, 1896, the Supreme Court of the United States heard the case of United States v. Freight Association. ",
        "Response": "Response: In this case, the Court concluded that the Anti-Trust Act applied to railroads and rendered illegal all agreements which are in restraint of trade or commerce. The Court further held that the agreement before them was of that nature and that its direct, immediate, and necessary effect was to put a restraint upon trade or commerce as described in the act. The Court also held that the intent alleged by the Government was not necessary to be proved and that the agreement was a continuing one, thus making its violation of law valid even after the act was passed. The Court reversed the decrees of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals and of the Circuit Court for the District of Kansas and remanded the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings."
