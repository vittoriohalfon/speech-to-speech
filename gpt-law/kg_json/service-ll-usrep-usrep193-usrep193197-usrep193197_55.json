United States (193 U.S. 359, 1903), what was the ruling of the court?\nResponse: The court ruled that the Anti-Trust Act included all contracts, reasonable or unreasonable, in restraint of interstate trade, and that the contract in this case was an unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and thus within the scope of the act. The court also ruled that individuals have the right to manage their own property and determine the place and manner of its investment, and that Mr. Hill could not be denied the right to purchase Northern Pacific stock because of his ownership of stock in the Great Northern Company."
