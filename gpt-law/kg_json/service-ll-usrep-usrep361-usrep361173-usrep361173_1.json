        "Response": "Prompt: Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway Co. v. United States et al.\nResponse: Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway Co. v. United States et al. was a 1959 Supreme Court case in which the Court affirmed the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The case involved rival applications by several railroads for authority to acquire control of the Toledo, Peoria & Western Railroad. The Commission found that the plan for joint control of Western by the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania Railroads was in the public interest and approved the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania application, dismissing the Minneapolis application. The Court held that the Commission's finding did not deprive the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad of \"fair comparative consideration\" and that the determination was supported by substantial evidence."
