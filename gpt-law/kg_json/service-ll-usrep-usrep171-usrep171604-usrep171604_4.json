        "Response": "Prompt: Anderson v. United States\nResponse: This case involved the question of whether persons engaged in the common business of buying cattle at the Kansas City stock yards, which come from different states, may agree among themselves to form an association for the better conduct of their business, and not transact business with other yard traders who are not members. The Court held that such an agreement does not violate the act of Congress, as it does not directly relate to and act upon interstate commerce, and the purpose of the agreement was not to regulate, obstruct or restrain such commerce. The case was decided on October Term, 1898."
