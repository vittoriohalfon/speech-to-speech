        "Response": "Prompt: In the case of Hopkins v. United States (171 U.S. 578), what was the reasoning for including this opinion?\nResponse: The reasoning for including this opinion was that the law does not prohibit the result of a partnership between two former competitors, as long as the partnership does not constitute a contract or combination in restraint of trade. The court noted that the suppression of competition was referred to in United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association (166 U.S. 290), but that this was in connection with a contract with a stranger to the defendant's business, and not with a partnership between two former competitors."
