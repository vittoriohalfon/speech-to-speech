United States was a case in which the defendants were accused of forming an exchange and adopting rules in restraint of trade and commerce between the States, with the intent to create a monopoly. The defendants admitted to forming the exchange and adopting the rules, but denied that the exchange itself engaged in any business. The defendants also denied that the exercise of their occupation as commission merchants, doing business as members of the exchange, constituted or amounted to interstate commerce."
