        "Prompt": "In October Term 1903, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) delivered an opinion in Northern Securities Co. v. United States. ",
        "Response": "Response: In this case, the Court held that the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce does not extend to the acquisition and ownership of railroads by persons or corporations. The Court reasoned that the power of Congress over interstate commerce includes the authority to regulate the instrumentalities of such commerce, but that this is distinct from the power to regulate the acquisition and ownership of such instrumentalities. The Court further noted that the rights of ownership in railroads belonging to corporations organized under state law, the power to acquire the same, to mortgage, to foreclose mortgages, to lease, and the contract relations concerning them, have from the beginning had their sanction in the legislation of the several States. The case was decided on October Term 1903, with Chief Justice White delivering the opinion of the Court, and Justices Peckham and Holmes dissenting. The case number is 193 U.S."
