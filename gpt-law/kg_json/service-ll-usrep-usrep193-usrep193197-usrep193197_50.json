        "Prompt": "What did the Supreme Court decide in Northern Securities Co. v. United States?",
        "Response": "Response: The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision that the Anti-Trust Act was constitutional and that the combination in question was in violation of its provisions. The Court also held that the power of Congress over commerce extends to all the instrumentalities of such commerce, and to every device that may be employed to interfere with the freedom of commerce among the States and with foreign nations. The Court further held that the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution does not prevent the Federal court from making orders or decrees to prevent the Northern Securities Company from exercising the power it acquired in becoming the holder of the stocks of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies. The case was decided on October Term, 1903, with Justice Harlan affirming the decree. The case number is 193 U.S."
