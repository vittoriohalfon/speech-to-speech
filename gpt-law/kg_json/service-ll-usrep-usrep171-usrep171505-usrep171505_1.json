        "Prompt": "What was the case of United States v. Joint Traffic Association?",
        "Response": "Response: United States v. Joint Traffic Association was a case argued on February 24 and 25, 1898 and decided on October 24, 1898. The case involved thirty-one railroad companies that had formed an association known as the Joint Traffic Association. The agreement between the companies was to fix the rates, fares, and charges for competitive traffic passing through the western termini of the trunk lines and other designated points. The agreement was to take effect on January 1, 1896 and to continue in existence for five years. The bill filed on behalf of the United States sought a judgment declaring that agreement void."
