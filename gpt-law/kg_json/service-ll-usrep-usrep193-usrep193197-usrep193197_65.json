        "Response": "Prompt: Northern Securities Co. v. United States\nResponse: This case was decided in October Term 1903 by Chief Justice White, Justice Peckham, and Justice Holmes, who dissented. The court held that the agreement assailed, even if it involved interstate commerce, was not in violation of any of the provisions of the Anti-Trust Act. The court found that the agreement directly purported to control the movement of goods from one State to the other, and sought to prohibit that movement or restrict the same to particular individuals, and thus was within the prohibitions of the act of Congress."
