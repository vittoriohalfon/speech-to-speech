        "Prompt": "What is the Dissenting Opinion in the case of United States v. Freight Association?",
        "Response": "Response: The Dissenting Opinion in the case of United States v. Freight Association was delivered by White, Field, Gray, and Shiras, JJ. on October Term, 1896. The opinion argued that the act of Congress relied on to forbid reasonable contracts which are universally admitted to be legal is that the act of Congress is itself unreasonable. The opinion further stated that the words \"restraint of trade\" only embrace contracts which unreasonably restrain trade, and that reasonable contracts, although they in some measure \"restrain trade,\" are not within the meaning of the words."
