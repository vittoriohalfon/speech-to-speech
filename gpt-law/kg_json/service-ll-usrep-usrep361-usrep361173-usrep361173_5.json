        "Response": "Prompt: Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. U.S., 185 U.S. 173 (1959)\nResponse: In this case, the Supreme Court held that the Interstate Commerce Commission had the authority to approve a railroad acquisition, even if it would otherwise violate the antitrust laws, if it found that the acquisition was in the public interest. The Court noted that the Commission must consider the effects of the acquisition on competition, but that it was not bound by the antitrust laws in making its determination. The Court further noted that the Commission was authorized to exempt participants in the acquisition from the requirements of the antitrust laws."
