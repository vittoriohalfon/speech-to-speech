        "Response": "Prompt: Farmers' Loan & Trust Company v. Penn Plate Glass Company (1901)\nResponse: In this case, the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company sought to foreclose on a mortgage held by the Penn Plate Glass Company. The Penn Company refused to insure the property for the benefit of the bondholders, and the court appointed a receiver to collect insurance moneys and hold $125,000 of the insurance moneys in case it was finally decreed that the complainant had an equitable lien upon such insurance moneys. The receiver was to pay over to the complainant so much of that sum as necessary to pay and discharge the $90,000 of the bonds secured by the mortgage."
