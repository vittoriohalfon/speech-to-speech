        "Prompt": "In March 1892, the American Sugar Refining Company purchased the stock of four Pennsylvania companies, resulting in a monopoly of the entire business of sugar refining in the United States.",
        "Response": "Response: In United States v. E. C. Knight Co. (1894), the Supreme Court held that this purchase did not constitute a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, as the object of the purchase was to obtain a greater influence or more perfect control over the business of refining and selling sugar in the United States, and not to restrain interstate or foreign commerce. The Court further held that it was not essential that the result of the purchase be a complete monopoly, as long as it tended to that end and deprived the public of the advantages of free competition."
