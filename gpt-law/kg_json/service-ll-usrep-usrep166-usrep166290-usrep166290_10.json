Freight Association?\nResponse: The Court held that the act in question was intended to cover contracts in relation to the transportation of persons and property, and that the debates and reports of Congress were not appropriate sources of information from which to discover the meaning of the language of the statute. The Court further held that the act was not directed solely at trusts, but also at combinations of competing railroads to keep up their prices to a reasonable sum for the transportation of persons and property. The case was decided on October Term, 1896."
