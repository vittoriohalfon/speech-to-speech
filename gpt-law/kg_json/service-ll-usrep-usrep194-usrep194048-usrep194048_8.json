        "Response": "Prompt: Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co.\nResponse: On October Term, 1904, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the State of Minnesota could not bring a suit in its name against the Northern Securities Company to prevent violations of the Anti-Trust Act. The Court reasoned that such a suit would be too remote and indirect, and that Congress had prescribed a specific mode for preventing restraints upon interstate and international commerce, namely, suits in equity under the direction of the Attorney General. The case number is 194 U.S."
