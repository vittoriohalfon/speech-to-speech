Texas was a case about the constitutionality of the Texas anti-trust laws. The Supreme Court of Texas held that the act of 1899 did not continue the provisions of the prior acts, whether constitutional or unconstitutional, merely because it was declared to be cumulative. The court decided the law of 1899 to be constitutional, because it did not contain the discriminating features of the prior laws. The judgment was affirmed. Date of opinion: May 24, 1897. Case Number: 197 U.S. 11."
