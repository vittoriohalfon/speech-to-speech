        "Prompt": "United States v. Joint Traffic Association, 574 OCTOBER TERM, 1898",
        "Response": "Response: This case involved a majority of the court denying an application to reconsider the same question in direct opposition to the conclusion arrived at in the Trans-Missouri case. The court had already twice considered the same arguments which were now for a third time pressed upon their attention. The court concluded that the decision was not erroneous and that it could not be changed from the opinion already expressed. The court discussed the effects of competition upon the business of railroads and concluded that agreements between railroad companies of the nature of the one before them were promotive instead of in restraint of trade."
