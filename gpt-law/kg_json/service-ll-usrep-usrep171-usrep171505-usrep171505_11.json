        "Prompt": "United States v. Joint Traffic Association (1898)",
        "Response": "Response: In this case, the parties agreed to abide by the pre-existing just, reasonable and lawful rates then on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The agreement also provided for the organization and administration of the association, and for the powers and duties of the managers to be so construed and exercised as not to permit violation of the Interstate Commerce Act or any other applicable law. The date of the case was October Term, 1898, and the case number was 535. The involved parties were the United States and the Joint Traffic Association. The reasoning for including this opinion was to uphold the agreement as it provided for the fullest obedience to law and promoted trade."
