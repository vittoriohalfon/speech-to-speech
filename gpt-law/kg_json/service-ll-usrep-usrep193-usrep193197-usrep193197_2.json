        "Response": "Prompt: On July 2, 1890, Congress passed the act of July 2, 1890, which was aimed at unlawful restraints and monopolies.\nResponse: The act of July 2, 1890 was leveled, as appears by its title, at only unlawful restraints and monopolies. Congress did not intend to reach and destroy those minor contracts in partial restraint of trade which the long course of decisions at common law had affirmed were reasonable and ought to be upheld. The general language of the act is limited by the power which each individual has to manage his own property and determine the place and manner of its investment. Freedom of action in these respects is among the inalienable rights of every citizen."
