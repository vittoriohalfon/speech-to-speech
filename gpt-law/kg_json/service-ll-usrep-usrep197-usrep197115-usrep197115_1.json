        "Prompt": "National Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas, 197 U.S.",
        "Response": "Response: This case was argued on November 1 and 2, 1904 and decided on February 27, 1905. The Supreme Court of the United States held that the Anti-Trust Acts of Texas of 1889, 1895 and 1899, which prohibited combinations to restrict trade, to limit competition in the production or sale of articles, or to increase or reduce prices in order to preclude free and unrestricted competition, were not in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment and did not, as against corporations dealing in cotton oil and combining to regulate the price of cotton seed, work a deprivation of property without due process of law, or impair their liberty of contract. The court also held that the act of 1895 was invalid, so far as it was discriminatory by excepting from its operation combinations of agriculturists and organized laborers, and that the act of 1899 did not continue the invalid discriminatory provisions of the act of 1895."
