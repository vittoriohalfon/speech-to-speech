        "Response": "Prompt: In Northern Securities Co. v. United States (193 U.S., 1903), what was the reasoning for including the rule of competition in a statute?\nResponse: In Northern Securities Co. v. United States (193 U.S., 1903), the reasoning for including the rule of competition in a statute was that Congress had the power to say that no contract or combination shall be legal which shall restrain trade and commerce by shutting out the operation of the general law of competition. This rule had been long applied by the several States when dealing with combinations that were in restraint of their domestic commerce, and Congress shared the general apprehension that a few powerful corporations or combinations sought to obtain, and, unless restrained, would obtain such absolute control of the entire trade and commerce of the country as would be detrimental to the general welfare."
