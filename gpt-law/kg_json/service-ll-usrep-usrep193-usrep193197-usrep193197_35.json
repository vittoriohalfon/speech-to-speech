The case involved a combination between the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, which was accomplished by the incorporation of the Northern Securities Company. The Government argued that this combination was in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, and the Court agreed. The Court held that the Anti-Trust Act was a remedial statute, and should be construed liberally and given the widest effect consistent with the language employed."
