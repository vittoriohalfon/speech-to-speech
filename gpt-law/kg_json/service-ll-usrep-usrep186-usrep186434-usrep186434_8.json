        "Response": "Prompt: In Farmers' Loan &c. Co. v. Penn Plate Glass Co. (455 U.S. 1901), what was the court's opinion on the existence of an equitable lien?\nResponse: The court held that there must exist a contract by the party owning either in presenti or in expectancy the property sought to be charged, which directly or by necessary implication expresses the intention to charge such property with the lien, in favor of the other party to the contract. The court further held that the grantee of the equity of redemption, having taken the property expressly subject to the mortgage, which contained a covenant on the part of the mortgagor to insure, on that ground alone came either under a direct obligation to insure the premises for the benefit of the mortgagee, or under an obligation to indemnify the mortgagor for his liability under said covenant."
