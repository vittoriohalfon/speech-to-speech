        "Response": "Prompt: Northern Securities Co. v. United States (1903)\nResponse: In this case, the Supreme Court of the United States held that it was unlawful for several men to unite to form a corporation for the purpose of buying more than half the stock of two competing interstate railroad companies. The Court reasoned that the statute of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209, made certain acts crimes and that the words of the statute must be read as if the question were whether two small exporting grocers should go to jail. The Court further held that the statute must be construed in such a way as not merely to save its constitutionality but, so far as is consistent with a fair interpretation, not to raise grave doubts on that score. Date of decision: October Term, 1903."
