        "Prompt": "What was the purpose of the Interstate Commerce Act?",
        "Response": "Response: The purpose of the Interstate Commerce Act was to secure the benefits of competition to all, and not permit a road to charge those shippers for whose patronage it does not have to compete excessive rates, while secretly granting lower rates to those shippers for whose patronage it has to compete. The competition was to be restricted to where it belongs; between the railroads and not between the shippers. The law provided no means for securing this desideratum except competition."
