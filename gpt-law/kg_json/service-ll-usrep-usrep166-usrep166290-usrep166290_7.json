        "Response": "Prompt: On October Term, 1896, the Supreme Court of the United States heard the case of United States v. Freight Association. \nResponse: In this case, the Government sought to dissolve the association and enjoin the defendants from entering into or acting under any similar agreement in the future. The Court determined that the agreement was illegal as being in restraint of trade, and that the injunction should go further than just the dissolution of the association. The Court also held that the mere dissolution of the association did not oust the appellate jurisdiction of the Court, and that the amount in controversy in the suit was sufficient to sustain the jurisdiction of the Court."
