        "Prompt": "In United States v. Joint Traffic Association (1898), what was the argument for the Joint Traffic Association?",
        "Response": "Response: The Joint Traffic Association argued that the agreement was not in restraint of trade or commerce, and that Congress had never declared or intended to declare it criminal. They also argued that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit unless it could be found in the provisions of some statute, and that the Anti-Trust act contained provisions purporting to create a jurisdiction in equity to give relief by way of injunction."
