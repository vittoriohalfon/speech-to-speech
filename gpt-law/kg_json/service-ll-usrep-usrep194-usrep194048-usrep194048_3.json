        "Prompt": "In the case of Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., what was the opinion of the court? ",
        "Response": "Response: The court held that the bill presented Federal questions both in its aspect of a bill by the State as a sovereign to enforce its local statutes, and as a landowner and shipper for relief under those statutes. The court also held that the cause was properly removed because of the plaintiff's assertion of right and claim of relief under the Constitution and laws of the United States. The court further held that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to decide, not only the Federal questions presented by the bill, but every question, Federal or non-Federal, that may be presented by the bill or arise upon the other pleadings or the evidence. The case was decided on October Term, 1903. Case number: 194 U.S."
