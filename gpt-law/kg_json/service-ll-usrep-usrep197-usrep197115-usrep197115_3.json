        "Response": "Prompt: National Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas, 197 U.S.\nResponse: This case involved the right of a foreign corporation to contest the validity of a state statute which violated the Federal Constitution. The Supreme Court of Texas refused to follow the precedent set in Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U.S. 540, and Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, 177 U.S. 28. The court held that corporations are \"persons\" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment and may invoke that provision against the taking of their property without due process of law, and the denial of the equal protection of the laws. The court also held that a state statute which violates the Federal Constitution is not binding upon a corporation and is not valid in any respect. The case was decided on October Term, 1904."
