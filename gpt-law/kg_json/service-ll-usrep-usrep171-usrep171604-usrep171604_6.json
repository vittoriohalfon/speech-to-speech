United States (1898), the Supreme Court held that an agreement between members of an association to not recognize non-members did not constitute a violation of the act of Congress regulating interstate commerce, as the agreement lacked every ingredient of a monopoly and had no tendency to limit the extent of the demand for cattle or to limit the number of cattle marketed or to limit or reduce their price or to place any impediment or obstacle in the course of the commercial stream which flows into the Kansas City cattle market."
