        "Response": "Response: In this case, the Supreme Court rejected the test adopted by the Court of Appeals which would have sanctioned price fixing in areas regulated by a State \"not inconsistent with the antitrust laws.\" The Court instead held that the party seeking immunity must \"show that state officials have undertaken the necessary steps to determine the specifics of the price-fixing or ratesetting scheme.\" The Court also noted that the proper state-action inquiry does not determine whether a State has met some \"normative standard\" in its regulatory practices."
