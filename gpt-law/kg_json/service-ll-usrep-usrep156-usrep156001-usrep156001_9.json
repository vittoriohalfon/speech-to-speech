        "Response": "Prompt: United States v. E. C. Knight Co.\nResponse: This case, decided in 1894, involved a combination of five coal corporations of Pennsylvania which had the power to control the entire market for bituminous coal in the northern part of the state. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found that the combination was a restraint upon trade and against public policy, and thus declared it illegal and void. The court noted that the combination had a wide scope, general influence, and injurious effects, and that it was more than a contract, but an offence."
