        "Response": "Prompt: Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. (1903)\nResponse: In this case, the Supreme Court affirmed a decree declaring that the Northern Securities Company had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by forming a combination or conspiracy to restrain or monopolize interstate commerce. The company had acquired a controlling interest in the capital stock of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, and had issued its own stock in exchange for the stock of the other companies. The Court found that the company had no capital to warrant such an operation, and that its authorized capital stock of $400,000,000 was just sufficient to represent and cover the exchange value of the stock of the two railway companies."
