        "Prompt": "What was the main subject of discussion in the case of United States v. Joint Traffic Association?",
        "Response": "Response: The main subject of discussion in the case of United States v. Joint Traffic Association was the effects of restraints upon competition as restraining, or not restraining, trade and commerce. The discussion focused on the agreement in question, as a whole, and particularly so much of it as affects competition, and whether it is in the highest degree promotive of trade and commerce. The Interstate Commerce law and its effects were also discussed, and it was shown that one of its main objects was to bring about uniformity in rates and put an end to the practice of discrimination."
