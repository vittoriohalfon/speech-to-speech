        "Prompt": "What did the commission say about relative rates in their first annual report?",
        "Response": "Response: The commission said that \"Questions of rates- on one line or at one point cannot be considered by themselves exclusively; a change in them may affect rates in a considerable part of the country. . . . Just rates are always relative; the act itself provides for its being so when it forbids unjust discrimination as between localities.\""
