        "Prompt": "In United States v. Freight Association (1896), what was the distinction between partial and general restraints?",
        "Response": "Response: The distinction between partial and general restraints was first formulated in Mitchel v. Reynolds (1711) and held that a contract creating a partial restraint was valid and one creating a general restraint was not. The theory of partial and general restraints established by that case was followed in many decided cases in England until Nordenfelt v. The Maxim-Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co. (1894) where it was held that the distinction between partial and general restraints was an incorrect criterion."
