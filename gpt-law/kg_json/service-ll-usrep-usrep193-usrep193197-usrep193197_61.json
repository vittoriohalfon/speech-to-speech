        "Response": "Prompt: Northern Securities Co. v. United States (1903)\nResponse: In this case, the Supreme Court held that the power to regulate commerce, conferred on Congress by the Constitution, related not to the mere ownership of property or to contracts concerning property, because such property might subsequently be used in interstate commerce or become the subject of it. The Court also held that the State of Maryland had the right to impose upon the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company the duty of paying to the State a certain proportion of all its receipts from freight, which applied as well to interstate as domestic freight."
