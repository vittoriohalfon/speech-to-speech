        "Response": "Prompt: What was the case of United States v. Joint Traffic Association?\nResponse: United States v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 U.S. 505, was a case in which the government sought to dissolve an association on the ground that the agreement restrained commerce between the States, and therefore was in violation of the Anti-Trust Act. The court held that the Anti-Trust Act did embrace interstate carriage by railroad corporations, and as that act prohibited any contract in restraint of interstate commerce, it hence embraced all contracts of that character, whether they were reasonable or unreasonable."
