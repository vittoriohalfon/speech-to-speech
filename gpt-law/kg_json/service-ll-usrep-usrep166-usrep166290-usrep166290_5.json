        "Response": "Prompt: On October Term, 1896, the United States v. Freight Association case was heard in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Kansas.\nResponse: The defendants admitted the formation of the voluntary association described in the bill as the \"Trans-Missouri Freight Association\" on or about March 15, 1889. They denied the allegation that they were not content with the rates and prices prevailing at the date of the agreement, and denied any intent to unjustly increase rates. They admitted that some of the roads mentioned in the bill received aid by land grants from the United States, and others received aid from States and Territories by loans of credits, donations of depot sites and rights of way. The purpose of the land grants, loans, donations and investments was to obtain the construction of competitive lines of transportation and communication to the end that the public and the people engaged in trade and commerce throughout that region of country might have facilities afforded by railways in communicating with each other."
