Hill, a citizen of Minnesota; and William P. Clough, D. Willis James, John S. Kennedy, J. Pierpont Morgan, Robert Bacon, George F. Baker and Daniel S. Lamont, citizens of New York. The suit was to enforce the provisions of the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890, which declared illegal any contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations. The Circuit Court entered a decree adjudging that the parties defendant had entered into an unlawful combination and conspiracy in restraint of interstate commerce, and enjoined the defendants from doing the things which alone give life and force to the combination. The Supreme Court affirmed the decree on October Term, 1903, with MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivering the opinion."
