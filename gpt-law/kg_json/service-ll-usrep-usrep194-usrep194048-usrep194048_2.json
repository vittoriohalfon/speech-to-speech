        "Response": "Prompt: Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co.\nResponse: This case was argued before the Supreme Court of the United States on October Term, 1903. The issue was whether the defendants had violated the Federal Anti-Trust Act and Article IV of the Constitution of the United States. The court determined that the case was properly removed from the state to the Federal court and that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction of the case as a \"suit arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" The court also held that the Minnesota Anti-Consolidation and Anti-Trust Act must be so construed as to make the constitutional enactments of Minnesota effective throughout the United States."
