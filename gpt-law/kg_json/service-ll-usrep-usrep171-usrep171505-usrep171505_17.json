        "Prompt": "United States v. Joint Traffic Association (1898)",
        "Response": "Response: In this case, the Supreme Court held that the Joint Traffic agreement, which operated as effectively as any pooling arrangement ever devised, was in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act. The Court reasoned that to prevent competition is in itself to violate the law, and that better the chance to violate one law than the certainty of violating another. The agreement was found to vest in the association, through the managers, with appeal to the board of control, the authority to change rates, which was more coercive than that conferred by the Trans-Missouri agreement. The Court also held that the public was not entitled to an arbitrary share of the through traffic and earnings, and that the provisions of the Interstate Commerce law preventing discrimination and undue preferences could be enforced without suppressing competition."
