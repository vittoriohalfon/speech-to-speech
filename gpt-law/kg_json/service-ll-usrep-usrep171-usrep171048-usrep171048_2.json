        "Prompt": "Citizens' St. Railway v. Detroit Railway (1897)",
        "Response": "Response: This case concerned the power of the city of Detroit over its streets. The Supreme Court of Michigan interpreted the relevant constitutional provisions as limiting the power of the city to grant exclusive privileges to occupy its streets for railway purposes. The Tram Railway Act of the time required the consent of the municipal authorities to the construction of a railway, but did not explicitly confer the power to grant an exclusive privilege. The court held that such power must be given in language explicit and express, or necessarily to be implied from other powers. The date of the opinion was October Term, 1897."
