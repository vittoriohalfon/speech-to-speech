        "Prompt": "In October Term 1904, the United States argued in the case of Swift and Company v. United States. ",
        "Response": "Response: The United States argued that the facts showed a combination which restrained or monopolized trade or commerce and operated upon and directly affected interstate or foreign trade or commerce. The combination sought to control the market for fresh meats throughout the entire United States so as to maintain uniform prices and destroy competition in the sale thereof. The court ruled that the bill of complaint was multifarious and misjoined causes and parties, and that the bill was too general and indefinite to require answer. The court also ruled that rights protected by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were infringed."
