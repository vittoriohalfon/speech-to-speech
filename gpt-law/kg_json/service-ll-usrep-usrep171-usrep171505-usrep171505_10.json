        "Prompt": "What was the case of United States v. Joint Traffic Association?",
        "Response": "Response: United States v. Joint Traffic Association was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1898. The case involved a challenge to the Anti-Trust Act of 1890, which prohibited certain agreements between competing railroad companies. The court held that the act was constitutional and applied to the agreement in question, which was similar to the one in the Trans-Missouri case. The court also held that the act did not violate the freedom of contract and right of property protected by the Constitution."
