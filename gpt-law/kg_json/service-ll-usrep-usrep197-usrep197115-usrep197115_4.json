        "Prompt": "In the case of National Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas, 197 U.S., what was the argument for the plaintiff in error?",
        "Response": "Response: The argument for the plaintiff in error was that the liberty of pursuit is one of the privileges of a citizen of the United States, and that the legislature cannot under pretense of exercising its police power prohibit harmless acts not immediately concerning the health and welfare of the people. The plaintiff also cited cases of exclusive contracts to sell, anti-monopoly laws, the right to form partnerships, and cases of contracts between competing companies which did not unite their capital, skill or acts."
