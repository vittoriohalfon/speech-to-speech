        "Prompt": "In United States v. E. C. Knight Co., what did Justice Harlan say about monopolies?",
        "Response": "Response: In his dissenting opinion, Justice Harlan stated that \"Monopoly in trade, or in any kind of business in this country, is odious to our form of government. It is sometimes permitted to aid the government in carrying on a great public enterprise or public work under governmental control in the interest of the public. Its tendency is, however, destructive of free institutions and repugnant to the instincts of a free people, and contrary to the whole scope and spirit of the Federal Constitution, and is not allowed to exist under express provisions in several of our state constitutions.\" He also stated that \"all combinations among persons or corporations for the purpose of raising or controlling the prices of merchandise, or any of the necessaries of life, are monopolies and intolerable, and ought to receive the condemnation of all courts.\" Date: October Term, 1894. Case Number: United States v. E. C. Knight Co. Involved Parties: United States and E. C. Knight Co. Reasoning for including in this opinion: Justice Harlan was dissenting from the majority opinion and wanted to emphasize the importance of preventing monopolies in order to protect free institutions and the public interest."
