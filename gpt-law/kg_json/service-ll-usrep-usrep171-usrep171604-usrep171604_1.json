        "Response": "Prompt: Anderson v. United States, October Term 1898\nResponse: In Anderson v. United States, October Term 1898, the Supreme Court held that the agreement evidenced by the by-laws of the Traders' Live Stock Exchange was not in restraint of interstate commerce, as the direct effect of the agreement did not relate to and act upon interstate commerce, and the purpose of the agreement was to properly and fairly regulate the transaction of the business in which the parties to the agreement were engaged. The Court further held that the rules of the Exchange were reasonable and fair, and could only affect interstate trade or commerce in a remote way."
