        "Response": "Prompt: In the Northern Securities Co. v. United States case, what did the court hold regarding the Federal Anti-Trust Act?\nResponse: The court held that it was sufficient to show that the acts complained of tended to bring about the results of suppressing competition or creating a monopoly, and that it was not essential to show that the person or persons charged with monopolizing or combining had actually raised prices or suppressed competition. The decisive question was whether the power to do so existed, not whether it had been exercised. The court also held that it was enough that the members of the combination or monopoly acted together in pursuance of a common object, and that an agreement or contract in the technical sense was not at all essential."
