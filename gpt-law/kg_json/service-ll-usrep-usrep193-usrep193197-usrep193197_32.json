        "Prompt": "What was the case of Northern Securities Co. v. United States about?",
        "Response": "Response: Northern Securities Co. v. United States was a case about the legality of a transaction involving the purchase of stock in two competing railway companies by a New Jersey corporation. The Supreme Court held that the transaction was lawful, as the means employed were lawful and the result accomplished was not unlawful. The Court also held that the mere fact that a contract has the effect of restraining trade or suppressing competition in some degree does not render it injurious to the public welfare and thus bring it within the police power. The case was decided on October Term, 1903, and the citation is 193 U.S. 291."
