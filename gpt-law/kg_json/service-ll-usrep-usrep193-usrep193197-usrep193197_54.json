        "Response": "Response: The Supreme Court affirmed the decree of the Circuit Court, which prohibited the Northern Securities Company from making transfers and assignments of stock in the Northern Pacific Railway Company and the Great Northern Railway Company, and suspended the injunction against paying dividends to the Northern Securities Company during the pendency of the appeal. The Court held that if there was a combination or conspiracy in violation of the act of Congress, the court could prohibit the parties to the combination from doing the specific things which, if done, would affect the result denounced by the act."
