        "Response": "Prompt: In October Term 1903, the Supreme Court of the United States heard a bill in equity, Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S.\nResponse: In this case, the Supreme Court found that the Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railway systems had entered into an unlawful combination or conspiracy to effect a virtual consolidation of the two systems and to place restraint upon all competitive interstate and foreign trade or commerce carried on by them. The Northern Securities Company was formed under the laws of New Jersey with a capital stock of $400,000,000, and the individual stockholders of the two railway companies were converted into an interest in the property and franchises of the Northern Securities Company. The Supreme Court found that this arrangement was intended to eliminate individual stockholders of the two railway companies and to suppress the competition between them."
