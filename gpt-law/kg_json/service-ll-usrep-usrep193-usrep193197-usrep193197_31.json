        "Response": "Prompt: Northern Securities Co. v. United States (1903)\nResponse: In this case, the Supreme Court held that unity of ownership of a majority of the stock of competing corporations engaged in interstate trade, no matter how such ownership is acquired, does not necessarily restrain trade. The court found that the ownership of a majority of the stock of the defendant railway companies did not restrain trade, as the ownership was used to build up trade, increase competition, and reduce prices. The court also found that the power of the defendant railway companies to restrain competition could not affect more than three or four percent of their interstate traffic."
