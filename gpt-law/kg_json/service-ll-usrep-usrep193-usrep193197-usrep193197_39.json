        "Response": "Prompt: In Northern Securities Co. v. United States (193 U.S.), what was the ruling of the Supreme Court?\nResponse: The Supreme Court ruled that any law of any State which restrains interstate commerce is invalid, and any contract between individuals or corporations, or any combination in any form which restrains such commerce is invalid. The Court also held that Congress has the power to regulate commerce among the States, and when in the exercise of that power it becomes necessary to legislate respecting the instrumentalities of commerce, it may do so, irrespective of the question as to how or by what authority those instrumentalities were created."
