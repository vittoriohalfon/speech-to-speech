        "Response": "Prompt: In October Term 1903, the U.S. Attorney General argued that the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies had been combined in violation of the Anti-Trust Act.\nResponse: The Attorney General argued that the companies had been combined in the form of a trust, whereby a majority of the stock of each road had been transferred to a common trustee, the Securities Company, which was thus vested with the power to control and direct both roads for the common benefit of the stockholders of each. The Anti-Trust Act condemns in express terms every \"combination in the form of trust,\" and if those companies had been combined \"in the form of trust,\" a violation of the very letter of the statute had been proved. The Attorney General also argued that even if the companies had not been combined in the form of a trust, a violation of the Anti-Trust Act would still have been established if it was shown that Mr. Hill, Mr. Morgan, and the other individual defendants had caused the title to a majority of the shares of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific companies to be vested in a single person, thereby centering the control of the two roads in a single head and in that way effecting a combination of them. The case is Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197 (1903)."
