        "Response": "Response: United States v. Freight Association was a case about the validity of an agreement between competing common carriers by railroad to maintain certain traffic rates. The court had to determine whether the agreement violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, which prohibits contracts in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations. The court found that the agreement did restrain trade or commerce and was thus prohibited by the act. The date of the opinion was October Term, 1896. The case number was 311 U.S."
