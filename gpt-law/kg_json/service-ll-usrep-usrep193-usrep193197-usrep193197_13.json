        "Response": "Prompt: Northern Securities Co. v. United States (1903)\nResponse: In this case, the Supreme Court held that the purchase of the Burlington stock by the Great Northern and Northern Pacific companies was not intended to have, and could not have, any effect on competition between the purchasers. The project of forming a holding company had its inception years before the Pearsall case, among several gentlemen who had been large shareholders in the Great Northern Company and its predecessor. The purchase of the Burlington stock was not made in view of the formation of the defendant, but solely from the motives and with the purposes of protecting the interests of the shareholders of the Northern Pacific Company."
