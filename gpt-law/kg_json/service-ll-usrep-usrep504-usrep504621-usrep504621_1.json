        "Prompt": "What is the case of Federal Trade Commission v. Ticor Title Insurance Co.?",
        "Response": "Response: Federal Trade Commission v. Ticor Title Insurance Co. was a case argued on January 13, 1992 and decided on June 12, 1992. The case involved the Federal Trade Commission's administrative complaint alleging that respondent title insurance companies had engaged in horizontal price fixing in setting fees for title searches and examinations in violation of ยง 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Court of Appeals reversed the Commission's decision, holding that the existence of a state regulatory program, if staffed, funded, and empowered by law, satisfied the active supervision requirement for state-action immunity. The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, holding that state-action immunity was not available under the regulatory schemes in Montana and Wisconsin."
