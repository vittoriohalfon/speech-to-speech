        "Response": "Prompt: What was the case of National Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas about?\nResponse: National Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas was a case about the constitutionality of Texas statutes that prohibited combinations to restrict trade or limit competition in the production or sale of articles, or to increase or reduce their price in order to preclude a free and unrestricted competition in them. The Supreme Court of the United States held that the statutes did not deny the oil company the equal protection of the law or take its property without due process of law. The court cited Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, 177 U. S. 28; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. State, 19 Civ. App. 1; and State v. Shippers' Compress and Warehouse Co., 95 Texas, 603 as precedent for its decision. The case was decided on October Term, 1904."
