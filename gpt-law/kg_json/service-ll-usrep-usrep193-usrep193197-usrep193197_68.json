        "Response": "Response: Chief Justice White, Justice Peckham, and Justice Holmes dissented in the Northern Securities Co. v. United States case. They argued that the right to acquire and own the stock of competing railroads does not involve the right \"to do\" as one pleases with one's own property, and that the government does not possess the general authority to limit the character and quantity of property which may be acquired and owned."
