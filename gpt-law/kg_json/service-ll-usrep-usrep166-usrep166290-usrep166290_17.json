        "Prompt": "In United States v. Freight Association (1896), what was the opinion of the Court regarding contracts in restraint of trade?",
        "Response": "Response: The Court held that all contracts in restraint of trade, as provided for by the language of the act, should be declared illegal. The Court refused to read into the act an exception that was not placed there by the law-making branch of the Government, as the impolicy of such legislation was not so clear and the reasons for the exception were not potent enough to permit the Court to alter the meaning and effect of the act."
